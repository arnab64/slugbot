You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?  Chandler : That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.  [Joey finishes his cereal, licks his spoon, and puts it back in the silverware drawer.]  Chandler : Waaa-aaah.  Joey : What?  Chandler : The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.  Joey : Yeah, so.  Chandler : Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?  Joey : Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.  Chandler : Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.  Joey : Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?  Chandler : Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.  Joey : Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.  OPENING TITLES [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment.

Joey : Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?  Phoebe : Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.  Chandler : Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?  Joey : So where you gettin' it?  Phoebe : I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters]  Ross : What? What's on your shoulder?  Phoebe : Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.  Ross : A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.  Rachel : Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?  Ross : No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?  Monica : Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.  Chandler : Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?

It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.  Phoebe : No, I think you should tell them.  Monica : No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.  Ross : I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'  [Scene: The Gellers' house.

You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.  Ross : Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. [opens door] We're here.  Mrs. Geller : Oh hi kids. Hi darling.  Monica : Happy birthday dad.  Mr. Geller : Oh thank you.  Ross : Hi ma.  Richard : Happy birthday.  Mrs. Geller : Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?  Ross : Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.  [Scene: The Gellers' kitchen.

Mrs. Geller : Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.  Monica : Are we still on that?  Mrs. Geller : We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.  Friend : She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up. [Monica folds her arms over her breasts]  [Scene: Joey's co-star's apartment. Chandler and Joey are at the brunch.]  Joey : Can you believe this place?  Chandler : I know, this is a great apartment.  Joey : Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.  Chandler : Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.  Joey's co-star : Hey.  Joey : Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.  Joey's co-star : Thanks. You want it?  Joey : Huh?  Joey's co-star : Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.  Joey : Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?  Joey's co-star : Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.   Chandler : [being left behind] Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.  [Scene: Mr. Geller's party. Mr. Geller and a friend are questioning Richard while Ross observes.]  Mr. Geller : C'mon, tell us.  Friend : Yeah, is she really 20.  Richard : I am not telling you guys anything.  Mr. Geller : C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.  Ross : Dad, you really don't want to do that.  Mr. Geller : Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?  Richard : Jack, would you let it go?  Mr. Geller : Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.  Richard : Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.  Mr. Geller : Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .  Ross : Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.  Mr. Geller : What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.  [Scene: Tattoo parlor. Phoebe and Rachel are deciding on tattoos.]  Phoebe : OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?  Rachel : Well I. . .  Phoebe : I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.  Tattoo artist : Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.  Phoebe : Here we go.  Rachel : [reluctantly] Uh-huh.  Phoebe : You're not going?  Rachel : Uh-huh.  Phoebe : What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?  Rachel : No. Well, yeah, maybe.  Phoebe : I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?  Rachel : What's 1922?  Phoebe : Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?  Rachel : Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .  Phoebe : OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?  Rachel : No.  Phoebe : OK, who is the boss of you?!!  Rachel : You?  Phoebe : No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!  [Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Monica is in the bathroom and Richard comes in.]  Richard : How ya doin'?  Monica : I'm a twinkie.  Richard : Really? I'm a hero.  Monica : Oh, this is so hard.  Richard : Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.  Monica : Maybe we should just tell your parents first.  Richard : My parents are dead.  Monica : God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.  Richard : I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.  Monica : Alright.  Richard : [walks out of the bathroom and runs into Mrs. Geller who is going to the bathroom] Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.  Mrs. Geller : Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.  [Monica jumps in the shower. Right after Mrs. Geller enters the bathroom, Mr. Geller peeks his head in.]  Mr. Geller : Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.  Mrs. Geller : I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?  Mr. Geller : I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.  Mrs. Geller : I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.  Mr. Geller : Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.  Mrs. Geller : Really.   Mr. Geller : I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.  Mrs. Geller : So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?  Mr. Geller : Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.  Mrs. Geller : [they start kissing] Oh Jack stop.  Mr. Geller : C'mon, it's my birthday.  [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler and Joey are returning from their brunch.]  Joey : Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.  Chandler : Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.  Joey : Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.  Chandler : Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.  Joey : Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.  Chandler : What?  Joey : I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.  Chandler : Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.  Joey : What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.  Chandler : Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.  Joey : Well that's how I feel.  Chandler : Well then maybe you should take it.  Joey : Well then maybe I will.  Chandler : Fine with me.  Joey : Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.  [Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Mr. and Mrs. Geller enter looking particularly refreshed. Monica follows looking rather pale.]  Mr. Geller : Who's drink can I freshen?  Mrs. Geller : Almost time for cake.  Ross : Mon, Mon, are you OK?

Monica and Richard are alone in the kitchen.]  Monica : Hey there.  Richard : What?  Monica : Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.  Richard : Humm, really?  [Mrs. Geller and Ross both enter]  Mrs. Geller : Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?  Richard : Uhh, not that I know of.  Mrs. Geller : Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?  Richard : That - that's an idea.  Monica : Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.  Mrs. Geller : Oh?  Richard : Oh?  Ross : Ohh.  Mrs. Geller : She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?  Ross : Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?  Mrs. Geller : So, who's the mystery man?  Monica : Well, uh, he's a doctor.  Mrs. Geller : A real doctor?  Monica : No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]  Mrs. Geller : Well that's wonderful. . . I  Monica : Mom, it's OK.  Richard : It is Judy.  Mrs. Geller : Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!  Mr. Geller : [enters with his bat] Found it.  Ross : I'll take that dad. [grabs the bat]  Mrs. Geller : It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.  Mr. Geller : That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.  Monica : Dad, I'm the twinkie.  Mr. Geller : You're the twinkie?  Richard : She's not a twinkie.  Monica : Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .  Mrs. Geller : Oh please, a relationship.  Monica : Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.  Richard : Really?  Monica : Yes.  Mr. Geller : Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?  Monica : Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.  Mr. Geller : When did I say that?  Monica : Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.  [Everyone else enters and all start singing Happy Birthday.]  [Scene: Tattoo parlor.

Phoebe : I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Rachel : Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.  Phoebe : I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?  Rachel : Really?

Chandler : No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?  Joey : I'm movin' out like we talked about.  Chandler : Well I didn't think that was serious. [grabs the spoons back] Ya know I thought that was just a fight.  Joey : Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.  Chandler : Well, there you go.  Joey : Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.  Chandler : Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.  Joey : Woah.

For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.  Rachel : Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.

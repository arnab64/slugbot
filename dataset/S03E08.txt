Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross are there, Rachel is serving brownies  RACHEL : Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?  CHANDLER : I will have one. (Ross and Chandler both take one)  (Phoebe takes a bite and spits it out and screams)  CHANDLER : Okay, I'm not gonna have one.  ROSS : That's okay. (they both put back the brownies)  PHOEBE : No, no, it's just my tooth.  CHANDLER : All right I'll have one. (he and Ross take another brownie,)  ROSS : So what's the matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.  PHOEBE : No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.  CHANDLER : See that is the problem with invisible dentists.  ROSS : Why? Why can't you go to him?  PHOEBE : Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.  CHANDLER : That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.  RACHEL : Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!  PHOEBE : Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend "Albino Bob".  RACHEL : And all these people actually died?  PHOEBE : Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!  ROSS : Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.  PHOEBE : Well, tell that to *them*. Oh! You can't, they're dead!

(Monica sarcastically mouths "Yeah!" and holds up her thumb)  JOEY : Hey-hey, Ross?  ROSS : Yeah.  JOEY : I've got a science question.  ROSS : Hmm? JOEY : If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact "Homo-sapiens", is that why they're extinct?   ROSS : Joey, 'Homo Sapiens' are people.  JOEY : Hey-hey, I'm not judging.

RACHEL : Oh God, oh God, it's kinda sewed on though.  MONICA : Give it. Give it.  RACHEL : Okay.  (Monica takes the bear, grabs his hat, and rips off his head)  MONICA and RACHEL : Oh!!  RACHEL : Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.  The street, Chandler and Joey are walking past a jewelery store  CHANDLER : Hey! Hold on a second, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?  JOEY : I'd really prefer a mountain bike.  CHANDLER : Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.  JOEY : Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.  CHANDLER : That's a good idea, "Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday". I would like to get her something serious.  JOEY : Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.  CHANDLER : All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.

Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.  JANICE : Why are your eyes so white?  CHANDLER : You tell me!

RACHEL : I also said "number one".  JOEY : I know. (giggles harder)  ROSS : (entering) Hey! Everyone.  RACHEL : Hi!  ROSS : How's my little boy?  MONICA : He's perfect (to Ben) aren't ya, Ben?

(Phoebe runs to the window and gasps)  (Cut to later, all except Chandler are staring out the window at Ugly Naked Guy)  PHOEBE : Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.  RACHEL : Well maybe he's just taking a nap.  JOEY : I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.  MONICA : All right, we should call somebody.  ROSS : And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.  RACHEL : Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.  MONICA : Yeah, but, how are we gonna do that? There's no way.  JOEY : Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.  Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is throwing darts, as Joey enters  JOEY : Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?  CHANDLER : Yeah.  JOEY : Well, now we got a reason.  CHANDLER : What?  JOEY : (like Bob Villa) Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.  CHANDLER : All right.  JOEY : Hey uh, what's the matter?  CHANDLER : I talked to Janice.  JOEY : Oh my God, is she going back to him?  CHANDLER : She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!  JOEY : What are you ah, what are you gonna do?  CHANDLER : I don't know, y'know? What, what, would you do?  JOEY : (starts to say something, then catches himself) Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.  CHANDLER : Come on, tell me.  JOEY : All right, you're, uh, probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I would bow out.  CHANDLER : What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?  JOEY : They have a kid together, y'know? They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, if there's a chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. (Chandler gives a look of understanding) Are you okay? You, uh, you wanna come poke a nude guy?  Monica and Rachel's, Ross has just finished putting Ben to sleep, and is entering from Rachel's room  ROSS : Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head ...  RACHEL : Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, but I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.  ROSS : It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know? It was your first time babysitting, I figure you did the best you could.  RACHEL : (confidently) I did!  ROSS : I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.  RACHEL : I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!  ROSS : Monica did it? (Monica runs into the kitchen from the terrace)  ROSS : Monica?  MONICA : Yeah.  ROSS : Umm, did you notice anything wierd about ... about Ben today?  MONICA : No. Why?  ROSS : Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out "e" and "f". It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.  MONICA : Really?!  ROSS : Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, I mean it's like his, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg. Yeah, he's in there just sort of y'know... (hobbles around in a circle)  MONICA : Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)  RACHEL : I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.  MONICA : (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! (starts to chase Ross around the living room)  ROSS : Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!  RACHEL : I'll get the hat.  Central Perk, Chandler and JANICE are there  CHANDLER : Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.  JANICE : Okay.  CHANDLER : I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family. Y'know, when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I would always think y'know "You're the reason, you are why they're not together." and I-I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or, y'know, how happy he made my Dad. JANICE : Wow!  CHANDLER : Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.  JANICE : Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say good-bye, there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate (starts to cry) and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.  CHANDLER : Then don't leave me!  JANICE : What?  CHANDLER : Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!  JANICE : No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.  CHANDLER : No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.  JANICE : (standing up) I'm sorry. (hugs him)  CHANDLER : Ohhh. Don't go.  JANICE : No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesn't let her go)  CHANDLER : No. No! No! No!  JANICE : Honey, honey, people are looking.  CHANDLER : I don't care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I don't care!!  JANICE : Yeah, um, okay, I'm leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of Chandler's grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe)  CHANDLER : You can't leave! I have your shoe!  JANICE : Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)  GUNTHER : Rachel has those in burgundy.  Monica and Rachel's, Joey, Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are holding the giant poking device  JOEY : All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.  ROSS : Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!  PHOEBE : I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.  JOEY : All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. (they start to advance the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the needle.  (They thread the needle and start poking him, he then stirs and swats at the poking device)  PHOEBE : He's alive! He's a-live!!!  MONICA : And yet, we're still poking him.  JOEY : Okay (urgently) retract the device, retract the device.  ROSS : He does not look happy.  RACHEL : Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.  JOEY : Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy! 
CLOSING CREDITS

(Phoebe enters) I can't resist your charms. And love...."  PHOEBE : (joining him) "Love...."  CHANDLER and PHOEBE : "I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind."  CHANDLER : (high pitched) "No you know I don't mind." Chandler and Phoebe: "Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh."  CHANDLER : "I know."  PHOEBE : "I know."  CHANDLER : "I've found."  PHOEBE : "I've found...."  CHANDLER and PHOEBE : "...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high pitched, Chandler goes low pitched) love." (they both look at each other) "My endless love."

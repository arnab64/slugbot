Monica : There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
Monica : Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
Monica : Are you okay, sweetie?
Monica : (EXPLAINING TO THE OTHERS) Carol moved her stuff out today. (TO Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
Monica : No you don't.
Monica : Rachel?!
Monica : (POINTING AT Rachel) De-caff. (TO THE GANG) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (TO Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
Monica : So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Monica : Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Monica : Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
Monica : Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Monica : Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
Monica : Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.
Monica : Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
Monica : Buzz him in!
Monica : Maybe.
Monica : Yes!
Monica : Rach, wait, I can cancel...
Monica : (TO Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
Monica : (HORRIFIED) Really?
Monica : Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (THEY ARE All LINED UP NEXT TO THE DOOR)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
Monica : (SHOWS PAUL IN) Two seconds.
Monica : Oh my God!
Monica : My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Monica : -leg?
Monica : You actually broke her watch? (CUT TO Rachel IN Monica'S APARTMENT, TALKING ON THE PHONE and PACING)
Monica : What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
Monica : Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Monica : Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Monica : (SPITS OUT HER DRINK IN SHOCK) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
Monica : Being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Monica : Wow! I'm glad you smashed her watch!
Monica : (PAUSE)...Yeah. Yeah, I do. (CUT TO Rachel WATCHING 'JOANIE LOVES CHACHI')
Monica : I had a really great time last night.
Monica : We'll talk later.
Monica : Shut up, and put my table back.
Monica : Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Monica : Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio.
Monica : So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
Monica : I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Monica : Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Monica : Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Monica : What for?
Monica : Hey, welcome back! How was Florida?
Monica : How do you do that?
Monica : You know Paul?
Monica : You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Monica : Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
Monica : Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Monica : I just thought he was nice, y'know?
Monica : How'd you pay for them?
Monica : And who pays for that?
Monica : C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
Monica : You ready?
Monica : Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it! (CUT TO SAME SET. Monica, Rachel and Ross HAVE JUST FINISHED WATCHING A FILM)
Monica : Well, that's it.
Monica : You be okay?
Monica : That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody. (STOMPS ON PAUL'S WATCH and GOES TO HER ROOM)
Monica : See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
Monica : What? I-I said you had a-
Monica : (TO Phoebe) Would you stop?
Monica : Alright. Phoebe?
Monica : Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
Monica : ..Excuse me?
Monica : How does she do that?
Monica : Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
Monica : What's going on with you?
Monica : Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
Monica : Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Monica : Wow, you worked in a mine?
Monica : Yeah, yeah.
Monica : (TO Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
Monica : Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? (SHE and Phoebe SCREAM) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (POURS THE CONTENTS OF THE BLENDER INTO GLASSES)
Monica : Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Monica : We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister.. (PHONE RINGS, Monica GOES TO ANSWER)
Monica : Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
Monica : (PHONE) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? ...Yes, hold on. (TO RACH) Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Monica : That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Monica : (PAUSES, THEN, TO PHONE) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Monica : You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
Monica : Ah, the other Jack.
Monica : So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
Monica : ...Pheebs?
Monica : No, you were right. I don't have a plan. (A KNOCK AT THE DOOR) Pizza guy (OUTSIDE): Pizza guy.
Monica : Phoebe?
Monica : Do you have a plan?
Monica : (LEAPS THE COUCH and RUNS UP) Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos'? Pizza
Monica : Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks? Pizza
Monica : Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
Monica : (STAGGERED) Oh God. Pizza
Monica : Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel PAYS HIM. Monica GRABS SOME BINOCULARS and RUNS TO THE WINDOW)
Monica : I see pizza!
Monica : White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Monica : Please tell me it's his mother.
Monica : Oh, no...
Monica : Light still out?
Monica : Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Monica : I think he's shy.
Monica : Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. (HOSPITAL)
Monica : Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
Monica : Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
Monica : What?! You slept with Jason?
Monica : Oh, that's nice!
Monica : Excuse me?!
Monica : Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
Monica : Where?
Monica : Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
Monica : Right foot red.
Monica : Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo. (A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Chandler OPENS IT and SOME GUY SILENTLY HandS BACK THE CUSHION)
Monica : Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
Monica : Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
Monica : Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Monica : Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Monica : Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Monica : Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Monica : [looking out window] Oh, god help us.
Monica : Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Monica : What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Monica : Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
Monica : Which?
Monica : You've never met Bob, have you?
Monica : Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly-- [Angela and Bob walk in. Bob is good-looking.]
Monica : --horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now. Scene: Central Perk [ Chandler and Phoebe are there, both ready to break up with their significant others.]
Monica : [to Joey] He is so cute. [to Angela and Bob] So, where did you guys grow up?
Monica : How, how did that happen?
Monica : What?
Monica : I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Monica : It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
Monica : Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Monica : Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please? [Her and Joey walk away from the table.]
Monica : Oh my god.
Monica : Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Monica : Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Monica : Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's--not really true, is it?
Monica : Oh my god, what were you thinking?
Monica : [hits him lightly] Oh!
Monica : [leaving] I'm outta here.
Monica : Really?
Monica : I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story. [Angela is eating chicken wings and making the weasel-like noise Joey had told Bob about.]
Monica : Hi.
Monica : We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Monica : [notices his head] Oh, I'm sorry.
Monica : Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Monica : Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
Monica : You could do that!
Monica : Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
Monica : Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Monica : Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Monica : What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Monica : Good for you, Joey.
Monica : We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Monica : ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Monica : How-how did that happen?
Monica : Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. (MOVES IT) Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
Monica : You guys, I am not that bad!
Monica : That is so unfair!
Monica : Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
Monica : Why not?
Monica : I could do that.
Monica : Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Monica : STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
Monica : Well, what's the part?
Monica : (TRYING NOT TO LAUGH) Oh my God.
Monica : Alright, alright, alright... (ENTER Joey WITH Monica'S PAPER- HE GIVES IT TO HER)
Monica : For what?
Monica : Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
Monica : He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
Monica : I warned you... (ENTER Rachel FROM HER ROOM)
Monica : Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
Monica : Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. (SHE OPENS THE DOOR and HE LEAVES) SCENE 5: FILM SET (Joey IS ENTERING FOR HIS SCENE)
Monica : Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Monica : Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Monica : I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Monica : (DETERMINED) Uh-huh!
Monica : Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (GOES TO HER ROOM)
Monica : Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Monica : [into phone] Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. [hangs up]
Monica : Hello?
Monica : [to everyone] It's Chandler! [on phone] Are you OK?
Monica : What?
Monica : I have no idea what you just said.
Monica : OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Monica : Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Monica : You did not go!
Monica : Outside.
Monica : Why not?
Monica : And that would be?
Monica : Joey, what's going on?
Monica : About what?
Monica : Oh my God! I love him!
Monica : My surprise party!
Monica : Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Monica : No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Monica : [to Ross] This is just Bactine. It won't hurt. [Ross flinches in pain.]
Monica : [smitten] Hi!
Monica : Hi!
Monica : Hi!
Monica : If you want, I'll do it. [Ross looks at Joey.]
Monica : I did.
Monica : Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality. All: Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Monica : Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Monica : Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana. [Scene 2: Hospital. [ Mr.+Mrs. Geller are there, along with Aunt Lillian. Ross and Monica enter. Everyone says hi and kisses]
Monica : How-how are you, Mom? Mrs. Geller: Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
Monica : What? Mrs. Geller: What's different?
Monica : Nothing. Mrs. Geller: Oh, maybe that's it. [Monica strides over to Ross, who is making coffee, and talks to him aside]
Monica : She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Monica : Oh God! [They hug. Cut to the hospital, later. Everyone is talking about Nana]
Monica : The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
Monica : I know.
Monica : G'bye, Nana. [She kisses her on the forehead]
Monica : Ross! [Ross runs out too] Mrs. Geller: What is going on?!
Monica : We checked. A lot.
Monica : Dad! Mr. Geller: Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
Monica : You what? Mr. Geller: I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
Monica : Define fun. Mr. Geller: C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
Monica : ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun. Mr. Geller: Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
Monica : That's probably what they'll say. Mr. Geller: I'd like that. Scene 6: Chandler's office block. [ Shelley is drinking coffee; Chandler enters]
Monica : Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Monica : Are these the shoes?
Monica : It was a really beautiful service. Mrs. Geller: It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. [Hugs her] Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream. [Joey listens to his overcoat for a second and sighs, then notices Chandler watching]
Monica : Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Monica : Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all. Mrs. Geller: No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
Monica : That sounds like Nana. Mrs. Geller: Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
Monica : ...I can imagine. Mrs. Geller: I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Monica : That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her? Mrs. Geller: Tell her what?
Monica : How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example. Mrs. Geller: I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Monica : Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth? Mrs. Geller: ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
Monica : Huh. Mrs. Geller: More wine, dear?
Monica : Oh, I think so. Mrs. Geller: [Reaches out to fiddle with Mon's hair again, and realises] Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Monica : Thank you. They're yours. Mrs. Geller: Actually they were Nana's. [There is a cry of disappointment from the crowd of men.] Mr. Geller: Now I'm depressed! ...[To everyone] Even more than I was. Scene 10: Central Perk. [ The gang are looking at old photos]
Monica : Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. [Reads the back] 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Monica : Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Monica : Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Monica : Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
Monica : I am not wrong.
Monica : No, I just talked to them.
Monica : Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
Monica : Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Monica : You know, they're not actually supposed to have... [Ross looks at her sheepishly] I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Monica : And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Monica : Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Monica : So you're free Thursday, then.
Monica : Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Monica : Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Monica : Rach, here's your mail.
Monica : [insistently] No, here's your mail.
Monica : [gives her an envelope] Would you just open it? [Rachel opens it. Inside is the money she needed.]
Monica : We all chipped in.
Monica : [to Joey] You owe me 20 bucks.
Monica : [hands Chandler a bag] Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Monica : Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. [notices Ross is depressed] What?
Monica : All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
Monica : That's not a question.
Monica : All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
Monica : Ah!
Monica : What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Monica : Why would we do that?
Monica : Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Monica : Got the keys? or Got the keys!
Monica : Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
Monica : No I don't.
Monica : No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
Monica : [panicked] The oven is on.
Monica : Well then get it, get it!
Monica : [angry] Joey!
Monica : Can you go any faster with that?
Monica : Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Monica : I swear you said you had the keys.
Monica : Why would I have the keys?
Monica : But I didn't.
Monica : Why?
Monica : Why?
Monica : Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! [starting to cry] Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Monica : Well, the turkey's burnt. [checking pots] Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined. [Ross enters, singing.]
Monica : No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? [picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes] Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Monica : Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
Monica : Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Monica : Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
Monica : [holding sandwich] Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Monica : Make a wish?
Monica : W-wait. What is that?
Monica : No, no, I don't.
Monica : Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Monica : Why don't you just get a roommate?
Monica : So, how'd it go?
Monica : So what are you gonna be?
Monica : I think it's romantic.
Monica : What?!
Monica : Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
Monica : Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Monica : Do you always have to bring him here?
Monica : I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Monica : Yeah.
Monica : What's the matter?
Monica : Vividly. [Someone knocks on the door; Monica gets it]
Monica : Hi. Sandy: Hi, I'm Sandy.
Monica : That thing is not coming in here.
Monica : I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
Monica : Alright. Just keep him away from me.
Monica : Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
Monica : Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby! [Everyone cheers. Monica opens the door. Bobby is obviously very depressed] Fun Bobby: Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Monica : Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby! [Bobby waves and then bursts into tears. Midnight comes and everyone at the party except for the gang cheers and kisses]
Monica : So I'm kissing everyone?
Monica : Why?
Monica : Oh my God. [Grabs Phoebe and turns her away] Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Monica : He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool. [The guy walks past them] Guy: Nice hat. Monica and Phoebe [unison]: Thanks. [The guy walks on]
Monica : We are not going to whistle.
Monica : No!
Monica : No!
Monica : [Shouts to the guy] Woo-woo! [The guy turns round, startled. Monica points to Phoebe. The guy gets hit by a truck]
Monica : Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Monica : Phoebe, what are you doing?
Monica : I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Monica : Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Monica : I wish all guys could be like him.
Monica : He doesn't have anyone.
Monica : Last night.
Monica : Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports. [Next is a shot of them dragging an enormous plant into the room, then Monica knitting a sweater, then Phoebe singing, then Phoebe shaving him and chatting to Monica]
Monica : Nah... not-not special enough.
Monica : Waaay too special. [Scene 4: A mexican restaurant. Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and his mom are there] Mrs. Bing: I am famished. What do I want... [Looks at Chandler's menu]
Monica : Yeah.
Monica : [Entering] What are you guys doing here?
Monica : ...What did I ask? [Scene 6: Hospital. Phoebe is there stroking Coma Guy's hair, when Monica enters with a bunch of balloons]
Monica : Hi.
Monica : What are you doing here?
Monica : I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Monica : How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Monica : Hey.
Monica : [Reading] 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
Monica : [Reads] Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Monica : Hello.
Monica : No, you?
Monica : You just asked me.
Monica : Oh! You're awake!
Monica : You look good! Coma Guy: I feel good! ...Who are you?
Monica : Oh, sorry.
Monica : I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Monica : I got you the foot massager.
Monica : I read to you.
Monica : Oh, my pleasure.
Monica : 'See you around'? Coma Guy: Well, what do you want me to say?
Monica : Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, 'That was nice'? Admit something to me? 'I'll call you'? Coma Guy: Alright, I'll call you.
Monica : This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and 'See you around'! Let's go, Phoebe.
Monica : What's a 'niffle'?
Monica : Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? [listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked] Nice talk, Aunt Syl. [in New York accent] You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth? [Camera pans back to group in living room]
Monica : So, did I hear Poconos?
Monica : Yeah, that's a big step.
Monica : And Monica knows...
Monica : Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
Monica : I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
Monica : Phoebe, what's the matter?
Monica : Phoebe, what is it?
Monica : Are you sure? [Flashback: Paolo, lying on massage table, grabs Phoebe's butt]
Monica : Was it...?
Monica : Oh!
Monica : So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Monica : Heads up Ross! [Monica scores on Chandler and Joey] Score! [points at Chandler] You suck! [Chandler looks at Joey in amazement] [Scene: girls' apartment]
Monica : Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, [shows Rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest], Ok, that is either how could you? or enormous breasts! Here he comes!
Monica : Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, [hands him a lasagna] but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
Monica : Oh, you're right.
Monica : Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
Monica : Yes! And that would be a shut-down! Joey &
Monica : Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Monica : You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! [Joey and Chandler pick her up] All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, [they throw her out] and I'm gone.
Monica : So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Monica : Hey, how long are you in the city? Mr. Tribbiani: Just for a coupla days. I got a job mid-town. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. [Sees Roger] I don't know this one.
Monica : Hello?
Monica : C'mon up.
Monica : Waitwait, go back to that sibling thing. Roger: Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
Monica : Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
Monica : Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
Monica : You're welcome. Roger: Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love. [He shuts the door and Ross and Monica fling cookies at it]
Monica : Hate that guy! [Throws another cookie] [Scene 4: The hall. Chandler and Joey are just leaving Monica and Rachel's]
Monica : Hi...May I help you? Ronni: Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
Monica : Okay...who are you? Ronni: Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
Monica : Oh, c'mon in. Ronni: Thanks.
Monica : How's it going?
Monica : Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
Monica : So you talked to your dad, huh.
Monica : How's it going?
Monica : Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Monica : You can not do this.
Monica : Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
Monica : But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
Monica : Which one was Pete Carney?
Monica : Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. [imitating] "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months--I didn't get to win once.
Monica : I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Monica : There's more beer, right?
Monica : Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Monica : Burning's good.
Monica : Oh, Chandler, sorry. [Janice turns around, Monica sees who it is.]
Monica : Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Monica : Rache, come see who's out here! [Rachel comes out.]
Monica : I'll be right back. [Joey enters from the stairs.]
Monica : Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. [to Chandler] He just happened to call.
Monica : All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Monica : Can we just start throwing things in?
Monica : Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
Monica : No.
Monica : Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure-- [Rachel throws the alcohol in the fire. A burst of flames shoots up from it.] [Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Joey are there. Chandler is preparing to dump Janice again.]
Monica : You know, it's a really funny story how this happened. Fireman
Monica : They're nice guys.
Monica : Rach, why does my swizzel stick have an eraser? [Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a swizzel stick. She takes the pencil out of Monica's coffee.]
Monica : Uh, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Monica : Um... hi there.
Monica : Yeah, yeah! Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Monica : [excited] Oh my God!
Monica : Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Monica : So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Monica : So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Monica : I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Monica : [to Joey] OK, try this salmon mousse.
Monica : Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Monica : Yeah, well, is that better?
Monica : [brings a plate of tiny appetizers over] Hey, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Monica : It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
Monica : [on phone] Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. [hangs up]
Monica : Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Monica : Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Monica : But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Monica : [shouting on phone] Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! [hangs up]
Monica : Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
Monica : Ten dollars an hour.
Monica : Twelve dollars an hour.
Monica : You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... [desperate] twenty dollars an hour.
Monica : Hi Steve!
Monica : [to Steve] This is Rachel.
Monica : Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
Monica : Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. [Steve sits, Monica brings over a tray] OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... [Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly]... with just a touch of mints... and... [he finishes]... ginger.
Monica : I'm so glad you liked them!
Monica : Oh, well... um, that's all there are of those. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Monica : [joining him and taking the taco shells] You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Monica : You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Monica : No, we don't. [reaches for box]
Monica : Why don't you just have a seat here? [he sits at the table, then tries to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.] OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
Monica : Give them to me.
Monica : No, give me the...
Monica : [furious] That's it! Dinner is over!
Monica : What?
Monica : Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet? [The oven goes off.]
Monica : I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
Monica : Ok, look, this could be a really long game.
Monica : Ross, that's my jacket.
Monica : Ross, your little creature's got the remote again.
Monica : Great.
Monica : No, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's but obviously someone forgot.
Monica : I can't believe you. You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?
Monica : Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument.
Monica : I'll get it. Hi, Mr. Heckles. Mr.
Monica : We're not doing anything. We're just sitting around talking, quietly. Mr.
Monica : Goodbye Mr. Heckles.
Monica : Ok, I think I get how to do this.
Monica : Ok, Pheebs, they're gone. Are you all right?
Monica : Come on, you gotta talk to Joey.
Monica : Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
Monica : Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or ankle or something.
Monica : All right. Name, address...Ok, in case of emergency call?
Monica : Really?
Monica : Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh. I love you. Insurance?
Monica : You don't have insurance?
Monica : I have no idea, but x-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Monica : There's not much we can do.
Monica : No no no no no no no no no.
Monica : That's insurance fraud.
Monica : Ok. Ok. I hate this.
Monica : Hi. Um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms.
Monica : I am really an idiot. You see, I was filling out my friend's forms, and instead of putting her information, I put mine.
Monica : Yep, that's me. I am that stupid.
Monica : Yes, yes she is.
Monica : Hi. Dr.
Monica : Thank you.
Monica : Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Monica : I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. I say we blow off the dates.
Monica : Come on, she'll be here any minute.
Monica : Well maybe we can make a "b" out of one of those roses.
Monica : Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Monica : Hi, come on in. Dr.
Monica : It's uh, well, uh, why don't you tell them? After all, it is your ankle.
Monica : It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Monica : A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, ok? Dr.
Monica : I said we are not going to do it. Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Monica : What?
Monica : What?
Monica : Yeah, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus? Dr.
Monica : (laughing) Oh, God, I am so spoiled. That's it.
Monica : I used to wet my bed.
Monica : We both do that. (phone rings) Dr.
Monica : Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um, there's something that I've been meaning to tell you. Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Drestin and I had sex on your bed.
Monica : Ross, he's got the remote again.
Monica : Find out what they want.
Monica : Hello, this is Monica. Yeah? Oh, ok, yes, we'll be right down. Thank you.
Monica : We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Monica : Thank you.
Monica : You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on an admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I, I put the wrong name again. 'Cause um...
Monica : I am. I'm that stupid.
Monica : What's goin' on?
Monica : Oh, thank you.
Monica : Michael. Dr.
Monica : Monica.
Monica : Hi.
Monica : Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
Monica : Hey, guys. Chandler,
Monica : Lots of responses.
Monica : [reading]: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. [crumpes up letter]
Monica : Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!
Monica : I mean, that's a typical guy response.
Monica : So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
Monica : Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites. Phoebe,
Monica : Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
Monica : [throws down her cards] Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Monica : Hell no, we'll pay!
Monica : And you know what? We want a rematch.
Monica : Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Monica : What?
Monica : Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
Monica : That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Monica : You're kidding! Where? Where?
Monica : Oh, Rachel!
Monica : Well, what's the job?
Monica : OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says. [opens door] Hi!
Monica : I don't think so.
Monica : What?
Monica : Really?
Monica : Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel...
Monica : OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.
Monica : Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?
Monica : You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever.
Monica : OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?
Monica : Excuse me, where are you going?
Monica : Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
Monica : Alright, Cincinatti, no blinds, everybody ante. [deals cards]
Monica : Me too.
Monica : [slams down cards] I hate this game! [Joey slides a plate away from Monica towards Chandler, who hides it under the table.]
Monica : Sorry, Rach.
Monica : Alright, check.
Monica : Rachel, there's nothing in it.
Monica : OK, here you go. Good luck.
Monica : [pointing at the drawing, upset] Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
Monica : Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
Monica : Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
Monica : What is it?
Monica : Barry who you almost-?
Monica : And Mindy, your maid of-?
Monica : [Takes it] That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. [Sees Rachel's look] Lucky. To have had a friend like you. [Scene 2: Monica and Rachel's. Rachel and Ross are eating Chinese]
Monica : Hi.
Monica : Wonderful!
Monica : There was nudity!
Monica : Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
Monica : Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
Monica : Which ones?
Monica : He- he pooped in my shoe.
Monica : Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
Monica : Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Monica : Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you. [They all leave]
Monica : Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it? Mr. Heckles: I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
Monica : No!
Monica : A monkey. Have you seen a monkey? Mr. Heckles: Saw Regis Philbin once...
Monica : Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel. Luisa: Marcel?
Monica : Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
Monica : Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller. Luisa: Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
Monica : The Luisa from home room!
Monica : No, none at all.
Monica : Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry! Luisa: Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. [To Rachel] But you? What a bitch!
Monica : Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats? Luisa: I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. [Leaves]
Monica : Marcel?
Monica : Whaaat!
Monica : What is it?
Monica : Look, Phoebe!
Monica : What're you gonna do? Luisa: Just a small tranquiliser. [In slow motion we see Phoebe look at Marcel, then at Luisa. She jumps toward Marcel just as Luisa fires the gun]
Monica : Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! [Marcel runs off and Luisa runs after him. Monica goes to check up on Phoebe] Are you okay?
Monica : Oh gosh. [Cut to Marcel walking along a hallway. He notices a banana on the floor and picks it up. The hand of an unseen person grabs him and carries him away. Then cut to Ross and Rachel on the street outside]
Monica : This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
Monica : That's because I'm in front of them.
Monica : Well, high school was not my favourite time.
Monica : Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
Monica : (LOOKING OUT OF WINDOW) Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
Monica : So have you called her yet?
Monica : I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Monica : Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Monica : How'd it go?
Monica : Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Monica : Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex- best friend?
Monica : THAT's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Monica : (RE WINDOW) Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Monica : Great, now he's waving back.
Monica : What kinda stuff..?
Monica : Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone. (Chandler DIALS HIS OWN PHONE. IT RINGS)
Monica : Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
Monica : (WandERING IN AFTER HER) Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
Monica : Uh huh.
Monica : You had SEX in his CHAIR?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
Monica : Brrrrrrr! (Chandler CLUTCHES AT HIS PHONE BEFORE REALISING)
Monica : Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.
Monica : Why don't you just take it with you?
Monica : Why don't you just call her?
Monica : Do you?
Monica : Don't you have to pee?
Monica : Just like you told her you did! (Chandler GIVES HER A LOOK) ... Just pointing out the irony.
Monica : So she's a woman! So what?
Monica : Joey!!
Monica : The green dress? Really?
Monica : (WAVES DISMISSIVELY TO SIDNEY) Nooo! (CUT TO Barry'S SURGERY. Barry IS PREPARING TOOLS ALONE) (ENTER Rachel)
Monica : You okay?
Monica : Really?
Monica : Aww... (THEY HUG) (ENTER Joey, WHO LOOKS ON APPROVINGLY)
Monica : Yeah, there you go!
Monica : I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Monica : I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Monica : That's me.
Monica : Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Monica : This woman's living my life.
Monica : She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Monica : Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Monica : Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Monica : Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Monica : This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother. [Scene 2: Central Perk. Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names]
Monica : Hi. [On the phone] Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Monica : [Hushes her] Alright, great. Thanks a lot. [Hangs up] I'm going to tap class.
Monica : This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Monica : What d'you think?
Monica : Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe. Teacher: You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
Monica : Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me? Teacher: [To the class] People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Monica : Okay, I'm not getting this!
Monica : Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated? [Rachel taps into view; she is in perfect sync with the rest of the class]
Monica : Great. It's gym class all over again. Phoebe and
Monica : Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare. [She starts to walk very slowly toward the front of the room. The teacher grabs her hand and pulls her. Suddenly a woman bursts in] Woman: It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl? Teacher: She's your partner. Woman: Hi. I'm Monica.
Monica : Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana. Woman [Fake Monica]: Monana?
Monica : Yeah. It's Dutch. Fake
Monica : You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. [Asks her something in Dutch]
Monica : Um, Pennsylvania Dutch. Teacher: And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight... [Cut to Central Perk. Ross has just arrived]
Monica : Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this- with this amazing spirit.
Monica : Monana was very brave.
Monica : It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor! Fake
Monica : So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
Monica : ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Monica : Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
Monica : 'Scuse me? Fake
Monica : There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Monica : Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class. Fake
Monica : Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Monica : What? Fake
Monica : Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Monica : Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned. Fake
Monica : I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Monica : Uh-huh. Fake
Monica : I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back'. And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Monica : Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire. [Scene 7: Mon+Rach's, later. Everyone but Joey and Monica is there]
Monica : Yo- hooo!
Monica : Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Monica : Noooo! [Comes closer and whispers] I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Monica : Water rules!
Monica : Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Monica : No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana! [The phone rings and Rachel answers]
Monica : Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Monica : They've arrested Monica. [Scene 10: NYC Department of Correction. Monica is visiting Fake Monica]
Monica : Hi. Fake
Monica : Hey.
Monica : How are you? Fake
Monica : I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How- how did you know I was here?
Monica : Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using. Fake
Monica : That I was not expecting.
Monica : I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in. Fake
Monica : Oh. Thanks.
Monica : No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theatre! Fake
Monica : Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Monica : I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus? Fake
Monica : Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Monica : Well, not... worried, just... wondering. Fake
Monica : There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Monica : Not necessarily... Fake
Monica : Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Monica : Um, I'm not actually Amish. Fake
Monica : Really? Then why are you like that? [Scene 11: Tap class. Monica is standing by the door] Teacher: You by the door. In or out?
Monica : In. [She joins in the dancing. She still flounders] Teacher: You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
Monica : Yeah, but at least I'm doing it! [Scene 12: The airport. Everyone but Monica is there to see off Marcel] PA: This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
Monica : Tell him.
Monica : Just...please tell him.
Monica : Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Monica : Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they?re still extinct.'
Monica : All right, I?ll see you guys later. [raises]
Monica : Thank you.
Monica : He?s... our age.
Monica : Okay, he?s a senior in college.
Monica : No, of course not. It?s not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
Monica : Oh, I can?t pass for 22?
Monica : I am 26.
Monica : Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt?s to tight, gotta change the belt. Did i turn the fish? [goes over to the kitchen to check on the dinner] No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?
Monica : What?
Monica : I don?t know. Look he?s a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don?t plan these things.
Monica : Yeah.
Monica : Did not.
Monica : How was that possible?
Monica : Okay. [They kiss]
Monica : Unless--
Monica : Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I?m going to, so...
Monica : Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I?m secretly married to a goat'?
Monica : Ethan--
Monica : Are you a virgin?
Monica : Really?
Monica : You keep saying that.
Monica : Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Monica : No no. Nothing wrong about that.
Monica : Um, okay, here it goes. I?m not 22. I?m, I?m 25... and thirteen months.
Monica : But I figured, you know, that shouldn?t change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are. [They kiss]
Monica : You?re not a senior?
Monica : Ok...ay. [Time lapse]
Monica : What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn?t alive during the Bicentennial.
Monica : Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Monica : Well, that?s different. My lie didn?t make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Monica : Don?t say it. [closes Ethan?s mouth with her hand]
Monica : Really?
Monica : Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn?t even be here, it?s a school night. Oh god, oh god. I?m like those women that you see with shiny guys like Chad. I?m Joan Collins.
Monica : What?
Monica : Oh.
Monica : No. You know, sometimes just things doesn?t work out.
Monica : Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now? Joey, Chandler &
Monica : Aren?t you gonna--
Monica : That was gonna be my opener.
Monica : It was.
Monica : Ethan, it?s um... it?s icky.
Monica : This isn?t easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really--
Monica : --love you. [Ross, Rachel and Joey come back from the bathroom. They discover that Monica and Ethan aren?t finished talking to each other yet.]
Monica : I can?t belive it, I?m gonna be an aunt. I?m gonna have like a nephew.
Monica : I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
Monica : Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?
Monica : What's with the guitar?
Monica : I want a baby.
Monica : Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
Monica : No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Monica : Oh yeah? When?
Monica : Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Monica : Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Monica : What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Monica : Well?
Monica : Did you go home and change?
Monica : No, I haven't seen him.
Monica : Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet. [Monica sees a woman pass by with a baby, puts the phone to her chest, and starts to cry. Chandler takes the phone, makes a noise in it resembling static, and hangs up. Joey enters.]
Monica : I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Monica : Hi.
Monica : Can we come in? [The whole gang enters.]
Monica : Ross, can I? [Monica holds Ben.]
Monica : [getting choked up] Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum. Closing Credits [The camera is placed as though it were Ben's eyes.]
Monica : He is so amazing.
Monica : Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Monica : Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Monica : OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Monica : Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Monica : Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Monica : Man's got a point.
Monica : Joey... we always know what you mean. [Time lapse. Chandler and Joey are making the fire, Monica and Phoebe are inside. Ross enters, carrying luggage.]
Monica : Hey.
Monica : You're going to China?
Monica : Yeah. [Phoebe puts the picture of Ross up to her face.]
Monica : Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Monica : You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Monica : [gets up] OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Monica : Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Monica : So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Monica : Y'know, just be there for her. [Long pause... Joey looks confused.]
Monica : Think about it. [They both walk over to where Rachel is opening her gifts. Rachel sees her first gift is a fruit basket.]
Monica : I can't believe he did this.
Monica : I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Monica : No, no, wait. [checks Ross's itinerary] His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Monica : From here to the airport?
Monica : Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Monica : Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Monica : Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
Monica : Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Monica : Another good point.
Monica : Why isn't it working out?
Monica : Is he not cute enough for you?
Monica : Does he not make enough money?
Monica : Is there? Is there someone else?
Monica : Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!? [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is eating breakfast, Joey quietly opens his bedroom door.]
Monica : Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Monica : Oh, from who?
Monica : Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Monica : Oh, why?
Monica : [gets up] No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Monica : I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise. [Door buzzer goes off. Rachel answers it.]
Monica : Behind my brother's back? [Rachel glares at her] ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me. [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is seated, and the apartment is filled with baskets of fruit. Joey enters, check in hand.]
Monica : I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross.
Monica : Guys, you got your hair cut.
Monica : This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
Monica : It's just an expression.
Monica : Phoebes, you know what I'm thinking?
Monica : No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
Monica : Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
Monica : Why not?
Monica : No you're not.
Monica : Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
Monica : Please, just a little bit off the back.
Monica : Rachel, how did this happen?
Monica : Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Monica : My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't--but this is about your horrible mistake.
Monica : You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Monica : I promise.
Monica : What? I didn't say anything.
Monica : I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Monica : How who wears it?
Monica : Demi Moore is not a he.
Monica : That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Monica : Oh my god!
Monica : She's the actress who was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost.
Monica : I KNOW!
Monica : Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Monica : Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Monica : Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
Monica : Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Monica : It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Monica : But I'm--
Monica : Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
Monica : You're welcome.
Monica : Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
Monica : We were shopping, and we had lunch.
Monica : You had a salad.
Monica : Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju-- Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Monica : Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Monica : Hey, where is everybody?
Monica : Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Monica : You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Monica : That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Monica : Judy.
Monica : Julie.
Monica : Jody.
Monica : Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Monica : Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Monica : Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out.
Monica : That is not true!
Monica : Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Monica : Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Monica : I don't know what else to say.
Monica : I feel terrible, I really do.
Monica : Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Monica : It's that terrible?
Monica : Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Monica : Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Monica : I'd do anything for you.
Monica : So how was Joan?
Monica : How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
Monica : Hello, Mr. Heckles. Mr.
Monica : We're not doing anything. Mr.
Monica : Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down. Mr.
Monica : Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
Monica : Mr. Heckles.
Monica : That's terrible. Mr.
Monica : What can we do for you? Mr.
Monica : Well, what about his family? Mr.
Monica : I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Monica : Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
Monica : It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Monica : You don't have any stuff.
Monica : No.
Monica : Mmmmm.
Monica : Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
Monica : Hide the Lamp.
Monica : Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
Monica : Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
Monica : Phoebe, tell her!
Monica : Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
Monica : You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
Monica : You are not a freak. You're a guy.
Monica : Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
Monica : No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
Monica : You made it!
Monica : No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
Monica : That's fine.
Monica : Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
Monica : (enters) Oh my god.
Monica : I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Monica : Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
Monica : Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Monica : Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Monica : Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
Monica : Oh, sorry.
Monica : Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
Monica : Oh, thank you!
Monica : All right, what's goin' on?
Monica : Ok.
Monica : If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
Monica : All of us.
Monica : I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
Monica : Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
Monica : Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
Monica : It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
Monica : Like?
Monica : Charity?
Monica : Guys, we bought the tickets.
Monica : Well, I guess now we can't go.
Monica : You know what? You're right.
Monica : All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Monica : You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Monica : You know, the guys are probably having a great time. Scene: at Monica and Rachel's
Monica : That was amazing!
Monica : Do I know you?
Monica : Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
Monica : You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Monica : Uh, wait, backstage?
Monica : Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Monica : Uh, good.
Monica : No, I just, I fell down.
Monica : You know, a party, or--
Monica : That would be the work of a Blowfish.
Monica : It's work.
Monica : (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
Monica : Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
Monica : Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.
Monica : Please.
Monica : Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
Monica : C'mon give me five more. Five more.
Monica : Five more and I'll flash you.
Monica : [to Chandler] Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.
Monica : Only if you say his full name.
Monica : Alright.
Monica : Why not?
Monica : OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
Monica : No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo [Chandler walks out of the apartment, leaving Monica] Woo. [Scene: Rachel and Monica's apartment. Rachel is taking asprin. Ross enters.]
Monica : No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
Monica : Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Monica : Well, thanks.
Monica : Well, you know.
Monica : [sad] Uh-huh.
Monica : Well no, but um.
Monica : Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
Monica : Alright.
Monica : OK. Just for a little while.
Monica : Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Monica : Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Monica : [getting the wine] Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Monica : Ohhhh. [Scene: Ross' apartment. Ross, Chandler, and Joey are there eating pizza.]
Monica : [reading the paper] There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Monica : There's an ad for a naked chef?
Monica : Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Monica : We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Monica : So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear. Mr.
Monica : I'm sorry? Mr.
Monica : Ohh. [He pulls out a piece of Mockolate.] Mr.
Monica : All right. Mmm-mmm. [She tastes it, and obviously hates it.] Mr.
Monica : [disgusted, trying not to show it] I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that. Mr.
Monica : [still chewing] Mmm-mmm. Mr.
Monica : Wow. Mr.
Monica : Just waiting for it to stop bubbling. Mr.
Monica : [with false enthusiasm] Mmm. Mr.
Monica : Abso...[swallows hard]...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate. Mr.
Monica : Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Phoebe are there. Monica is suggesting Mockolate recipes to Phoebe.]
Monica : How about Mockolate mousse?
Monica : Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
Monica : We'll put buckles on it. [Rachel enters.]
Monica : Hey.
Monica : No, I'm sorry.
Monica : Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served. [Rachel takes a bite.]
Monica : Oh my god good?
Monica : You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
Monica : What?
Monica : This was your idea?
Monica : Yeah. You!
Monica : Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate? [Ross runs to Rachel's bedroom, knocking on the door.]
Monica : Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate. Mr.
Monica : What? Mr.
Monica : Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. Mr.
Monica : Well, uh, I ate some. Mr.
Monica : Hello? [Ross is at his apartment.]
Monica : [to Ross] Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Monica : Sure, what? Ok, ok. [hangs up the phone] [to Rachel] Music? [Monica turns on the radio.]
Monica : Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash. Mr.
Monica : Cat hair. Mr.
Monica : Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
Monica : Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
Monica : Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy. [Joey opens the door and picks up the remnants of the newspaper.
Monica : Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Monica : Cute.
Monica : Ross, that is gorgeous!
Monica : Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy. [Phoebe enters.]
Monica : Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
Monica : Oh, wait a minute honey.
Monica : Wow.
Monica : Hi.
Monica : I hope she's OK.
Monica : How do you know exactly what she's going through?
Monica : Just some stuff for the party.
Monica : You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
Monica : Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
Monica : For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive. [Rachel enters from her room]
Monica : Rach, get the heat. [Rachel holds up her hand with wet fingernail polish] Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
Monica : Ross, the heat!
Monica : Well put it back.
Monica : Here, let me try.
Monica : Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
Monica : No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
Monica : [carrying an ice cube tray] Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
Monica : Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. [one of the guest opens the refrigerator] Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next. [she opens the refrigerator and leans into it]
Monica : No, I will not cave.
Monica : Ross.
Monica : [to Ross] Looks like he's playin' baseball.
Monica : Whatever.
Monica : So, wait, you really did like my cookies? Mr.
Monica : Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
Monica : Honey, I'm sorry.
Monica : You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.
Monica : Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind. [Reads from paper] In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153...[turns it] sucking. Credits [Scene: Chandler, Phoebe, Rachel, Monica comforting Joey at Monica and Rachel's apartment.]
Monica : Maybe.
Monica : You and me both. Fun
Monica : OK, I'll see you later babe. Fun
Monica : Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
Monica : And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
Monica : Really? I only had two glasses.
Monica : So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Monica : Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo. [Scene: Monica, Fun Bobby, and Phoebe sitting in Central Perk Rachel is serving them. She brings a mug to Monica.]
Monica : Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Monica : [takes a sip] Mmmm, no.
Monica : You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately. Fun
Monica : Bobby. Fun
Monica : Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you. Fun
Monica : So, what are you saying now? Fun
Monica : Hey.
Monica : [gasps] You have other friends?
Monica : What?
Monica : What are you talking about?
Monica : It's Fun Bobby.
Monica : Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Monica : Alright, here you go, sweetie. [hands Fun Bobby his coffee] Fun
Monica : Oh God, yes! Fun
Monica : Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now? Fun
Monica : Oh.... my... God.
Monica : Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
Monica : But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.
Monica : She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
Monica : See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
Monica : Bye.
Monica : Do you not see it?
Monica : Yes, I would like something. [looks at Fun Bobby, changes her mind] No, no thank you. Fun
Monica : No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. [to waiter] Just some water. Fun
Monica : [grabs waiter as he's leaving] I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist. [Scene: Central Perk. Chandler is sitting on the couch between Russ and Ross, doing a crossword puzzle.]
Monica : Morning.
Monica : Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
Monica : Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing. [Three slow knocks on the door.]
Monica : Hi. I'll be ready in just a second. Fun
Monica : Sure. [They both step out into the hall.] Fun
Monica : Oh God, you fell off the wagon. Fun
Monica : What about me? Fun
Monica : What these? [holding up liquor bottles] Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes. Fun
Monica : Oh... shoot. Fun
Monica : OK. [They hug and kiss.]
Monica : Take care. Fun
Monica : Well we... we kinda broke up.
Monica : [holding bottles] Does anybody want these?
Monica : Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast. Ross, Chandler &
Monica : They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Monica : Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!
Monica : They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
Monica : Ross, I thought you were over this.
Monica : What?
Monica : Oh, honey.
Monica : God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.
Monica : [entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Monica : Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
Monica : Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
Monica : Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Monica : Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Monica : If you want.
Monica : All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. Mrs.
Monica : I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything. Mrs.
Monica : All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
Monica : Joey, speed it up!
Monica : Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
Monica : [to Ross] All right, you!
Monica : All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
Monica : Hi.
Monica : It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers. [everyone groans]
Monica : You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.
Monica : So we're back on?
Monica : You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes. [at the wedding]
Monica : Would you look at them?
Monica : Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?
Monica : All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.
Monica : And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Monica : [reading] 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not- so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
Monica : This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
Monica : I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
Monica : Yeah.
Monica : Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Monica : Excellent!
Monica : Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
Monica : And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. [throws water in his face]
Monica : Ross, there he is.
Monica : Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
Monica : Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
Monica : The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
Monica : Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
Monica : Oh, yeah.
Monica : He could hear me.
Monica : Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
Monica : So what'd he say?
Monica : Well, thanks anyway.
Monica : Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...
Monica : Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
Monica : What did you say?
Monica : Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
Monica : You sold me out.
Monica : Yes you did. Absolutely.
Monica : Did you just flick me?
Monica : Quit flicking [flicks]
Monica : You flicked me first. [They keep flicking each other. This turns into slapping each other. This leads to wrestling on the floor. All the while Phoebe is saying "Happy thoughts". Eventually Phoebe gets fed up.]
Monica : Uh-huh.
Monica : OK.
Monica : Yes.
Monica : Fine,
Monica : I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? [he nods] Can you beat up that guy? Van
Monica : This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date. Van
Monica : Well, what made you make the exception for me? Van
Monica : Say you're sorry.
Monica : Say it.
Monica : Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
Monica : Say you're sorry.
Monica : What're you gonna do?
Monica : You don't have the guts.
Monica : I'll help you fix your sweater.
Monica : I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
Monica : I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves [pulls Rachel's gloves out of her purse] [Scene: Back at the restroom at Marcel's. Chandler is still in the stall, Joey comes in to go to the bathroom.] [Joey starts whistling, Chandler finishes the tune. Joey whistles again.]
Monica : Well, bye for me too. [kisses him]
Monica : OK. Van
Monica : But no. Maybe if I were baking. Monica and
Monica : Great.
Monica : Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
Monica : A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
Monica : You got it.
Monica : Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Monica : Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Monica : That's your call.
Monica : Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Monica : They'r alright.
Monica : No really, they're OK.
Monica : Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Monica : I'm outa here. [Monica leaves] [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Phoebe are sitting at the couch. Ross is sitting at the table and answers the phone.]
Monica : Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
Monica : Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
Monica : No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Monica : Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few doubloons. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica answers the door and lets her parents in. They are carrying boxes.]
Monica : Hi. Mr.
Monica : So, what's this. Mr.
Monica : Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room? Mr.
Monica : Oh, God forbid. [Rachel enters with a laundry basket] Mrs.
Monica : Where have you been?
Monica : No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
Monica : Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it. Mrs.
Monica : Because they made me. Mrs.
Monica : Anything larger back there? [Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Phoebe enter.]
Monica : You have dinosaur checks?
Monica : Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
Monica : Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then.
Monica : Hey, you got me, put it in.
Monica : You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Monica : Over here dad. [he pans over and we see a torso taking up the whole screen] Mr.
Monica : Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Monica : Oh, you look so great.
Monica : Oops.
Monica : Shoot, I think I got mayonaise on you.
Monica : Oh, dad, turn it off. Mr.
Monica : Dad, it is not. What's with the red light? Mr.
Monica : Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Monica : I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
Monica : If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Monica : I can't believe you did that.
Monica : Mom, I'm hungry. Mrs.
Monica : Alright. [the tape cuts to Monica's parents under the covers] Mrs.
Monica : Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she? [Rachel enters]
Monica : [walks up to Rachel in front of the TV] Tonight? Chandler and
Monica : What's tonight?
Monica : Uh, hello.
Monica : Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
Monica : Yes but my mom got me this job.
Monica : Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
Monica : Sorry we're late. Dr.
Monica : Dr. Burke, it, it's me. Dr.
Monica : Thank you. This is my friend Phoebe. She's gonna be helping me tonight. Dr.
Monica : I've been great, just great. How have you been? [tilting her head] Dr.
Monica : The head tilt? Dr.
Monica : I'm sorry. Dr.
Monica : [her and Phoebe tilt their heads] Oh, that's too bad. Dr.
Monica : You've got to get back out there, it's your party. Dr.
Monica : You're an opthamologist. Dr.
Monica : Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency. Dr.
Monica : I am not.
Monica : Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
Monica : Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
Monica : Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
Monica : Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Ross and Rachel are returning from a movie.]
Monica : Really. Dr.
Monica : Good, they feel good, in my head. Dr.
Monica : You too. Dr.
Monica : OK, um. Goodbye. Dr.
Monica : What? Dr.
Monica : Thanks. So, I guess I better be going. Dr.
Monica : Thanks again. [He kisses her on the cheek, she returns the kiss, then they embrace in a full on kiss] [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. They're still watching TV. Phoebe stands in front of the TV.]
Monica : Stop sending food to our apartment.
Monica : No one.
Monica : Nothing.
Monica : Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.
Monica : It's Richard Burke.
Monica : Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.
Monica : When?
Monica : Wow, is that Michelle? Dr.
Monica : I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional. Dr.
Monica : I thought she just had one. Dr.
Monica : Oh, you're a grandpa. Dr.
Monica : I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in. Dr.
Monica : Yeah. Dr.
Monica : So maybe we should just. . . Dr.
Monica : Wow, this really sucks. Dr.
Monica : Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we? Dr.
Monica : Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys. [Scene: Museum of Natural History. Ross enters the display where Rachel is waiting.]
Monica : I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
Monica : Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Monica : Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
Monica : Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
Monica : No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Monica : OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Monica : Happy birthday dad. Mr.
Monica : Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom. Mrs.
Monica : Are we still on that? Mrs.
Monica : I'm a twinkie.
Monica : Oh, this is so hard.
Monica : Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
Monica : God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
Monica : Alright.
Monica : You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Monica : Well, I just caught the live show.
Monica : Hey there.
Monica : Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
Monica : Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone. Mrs.
Monica : Well, uh, he's a doctor. Mrs.
Monica : No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard] Mrs.
Monica : Mom, it's OK.
Monica : Dad, I'm the twinkie. Mr.
Monica : Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . . Mrs.
Monica : Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Monica : Yes. Mr.
Monica : Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier. Mr.
Monica : Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom. [Everyone else enters and all start singing Happy Birthday.] [Scene: Tattoo parlor. Rachel is showing Phoebe her tattoo.]
Monica : So, are you sorry that I told them?
Monica : Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
Monica : No he went out to get pizza.
Monica : That's great.
Monica : Yes.
Monica : I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
Monica : [looking at some kind of glass sculpture thing] Wow Joey, this is, uhh...
Monica : Art it is.
Monica : Joey, promise me something.
Monica : Never call me from that phone. OPENING TITLES [Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Chandler, and Ross are seated. Rachel is walking over with coffee and a piece of pie.] [Someone bumps into Rachel and she drops the pie in a guy's hood that's seated at the table. She improvises by using the plate as a saucer for the coffee.]
Monica : Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.
Monica : Blow drying what, you have no hair.
Monica : Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again.
Monica : GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
Monica : I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Monica : Shut up.
Monica : Cut it out.
Monica : But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
Monica : I promise you, he would definitely want you back. [Scene: Chandler's apartment. Chandler is sitting between Rachel and Ross.]
Monica : I was.
Monica : Did she leave a number?
Monica : I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Monica : I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
Monica : You wanna get out of my face?
Monica : Give me that.
Monica : Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom. [she starts throwing oranges at Ross who's looking pleased with himself] [Scene: Chandler's apartment. Chandler is sitting on the bar, bouncing a ball against the door. Joey walks in right as he throws the ball and catches it.]
Monica : I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Monica : I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Monica : It's my TV.
Monica : Bite me.
Monica : Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.
Monica : OK, what're we gonna do about this?
Monica : Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.
Monica : I just can't stand you being here all the time.
Monica : Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
Monica : Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
Monica : Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
Monica : Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.
Monica : Duh-huh!
Monica : Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
Monica : Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
Monica : Then I won't have to kill you.
Monica : Yeah, thanks. You know what?
Monica : If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.
Monica : So what're you gonna do?
Monica : Sure.
Monica : [sings] They won't take you to the vet.
Monica : Joey.
Monica : We, we just wanna see the end.
Monica : Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
Monica : Well, maybe you don't need them.
Monica : Shut up, I'm happy.
Monica : Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
Monica : Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
Monica : Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
Monica : Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
Monica : Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. [goes in the bathroom]
Monica : Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark. [Rachel's bedroom]
Monica : Well yeah.
Monica : You really ok with it?
Monica : Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
Monica : Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Monica : And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Monica : But you've only slept with two people.
Monica : Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
Monica : Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
Monica : I know. I just can't find...
Monica : You need one too?
Monica : There's only one.
Monica : Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something. [shuts the bathroom door]
Monica : No.
Monica : Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
Monica : Yeah. Rachel and
Monica : One two three. [Rachel picks rock, Monica picks scissors]
Monica : Fine, go have sex.
Monica : It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
Monica : Why?
Monica : Wait, he's not here yet.
Monica : Alright.
Monica : Did they just kill off Joey?
Monica : And some of us really have to pee. [Joey opens the door]
Monica : Sorry Joey [runs to the bathroom]
Monica : Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
Monica : Hey.
Monica : A mirror?
Monica : Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Monica : Cache? Jaunty?
Monica : Hey.
Monica : Oh my God, it was incredible.
Monica : Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
Monica : It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard.
Monica : No.
Monica : Yes. But all the other ones.
Monica : Isn't it.
Monica : Hey.
Monica : You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Monica : Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
Monica : I wa-
Monica : And I would have to say pah-huh.
Monica : Do you not remember the puppet guy?
Monica : And his puppet too.
Monica : Who?
Monica : Oh.
Monica : Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Monica : Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Monica : One hour? You are such a leaf blower. [Monica goes into her room and slams the door. Rachel does the same. Phoebe, without a door to slam, opens a small chest and slams the lid.] [Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey is watching movers take all his stuff away.]
Monica : We didn't order cake.
Monica : You're right.
Monica : We're good.
Monica : Are you sure this time?
Monica : There is no alley behind Macy's.
Monica : So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?
Monica : Nice.
Monica : Guys, look what I found in the drain. It's some of Richard's hair. What do I do with this?
Monica : It's weird, but, you know, I don't want to throw this away. I mean, this is like all I have left of him... gRoss, drain hair. Eww! [She throws the hair down which lands in Ross cereal bowl.]
Monica : God, what is wrong with me?
Monica : I need to get some Richard.
Monica : I know. I know. But I'm so tired of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why he hasn't called. [angrily] Why hasn't he called?
Monica : [to Phoebe] What are you? The memory woman?
Monica : [dazed] Oh, they sent me home.
Monica : [still dazed] Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
Monica : I know I do.
Monica : Richard's living room, drinking wine.
Monica : Sorry, but that's my happy place.
Monica : Alright, I'll try not to.
Monica : Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
Monica : I'll bet he's totally over me. I'll bet he's fine.
Monica : Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee. [she climbs out of bed and leaves the room] [Scene: Joey and Chandler's apartment. Janice and Joey are both there, standing around.]
Monica : [sobbing] So, I went down to the Post Office. It turns out it was the videos I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. [Monica starts crying] He loved the Civil War.
Monica : Uh-huh. [looking over toward Ross on the couch] Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. [Phoebe, Monica, and Rachel leave.]
Monica : Hi, Dad. What are you doing here?
Monica : I don't. I just like the smell of them. [they walk over to the couch] So, what are you really doing here, Dad?
Monica : What makes you think that I might not be okay?
Monica : Oh.
Monica : Fine. Just a little tired. I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
Monica : No, I really, really do.
Monica : Really?
Monica : You're not just saying that, are you?
Monica : Was he crying?
Monica : Well, do you think he was waiting til after you left so he could cry?
Monica : I think so.
Monica : Hi.
Monica : Ooh, Phoebe, you look great.
Monica : [looking at Ross in tuxedo] Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
Monica : Hold on a second, I just got in.
Monica : Has somebody been drinking my fat? [Joey and Chandler look at each other.]
Monica : Rach, did you check the machine?
Monica : Is that message old or new? [nobody speaks] Old or new, old or new!?!?
Monica : But what if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk. He could have something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Monica : [coming out of bedroom] If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
Monica : So, should I call him back?
Monica : I called him. [everybody gasps] I got his machine and I left him a message. But it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Because you know, it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy. [pause] Oh god, what if it wasn't breezy?
Monica : I got it. I will play my message for you guys and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Monica : I know the code to his answering machine.
Monica : He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
Monica : Well, whose voice was that?
Monica : Michelle. Of course, it was Michelle. Did it sound like Michelle?
Monica : It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
Monica : [coming in] Okay, I've gotta call Michelle. I've gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry. I just have to.
Monica : Okay. That was her, right? [everybody agrees] So, there you go. Wooo. We're out of the woods. I think I'll get dressed now. [Phone rings.]
Monica : Uh, Michelle. [pause] Yeah, that was me. I dialed your number by mistake. [pause] You're so sweet. [pause] Yeah, we were a great couple. [pause] I know. I really miss him. [pause] Well, you know how it is...[leaves room talking on phone]
Monica : [comes back in, still on phone] ...Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my own message. I mean, that's allowed. [pause] Yuh-uh! You know, I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't tell your dad... [pause] What do you mean you don't feel comfortable with this? Come on! We're friends! [dial tone] That bitch always hated me. I'm gonna call her back.
Monica : Okay. Fine. [heads toward her bedroom]
Monica : Not anymore.
Monica : Hi, Richard. It's Monica. Listen, I did something kind of crazy tonight. Maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Anyway, I beeped into your machine and I heard this message that freaked me out. You know what, Michelle will tell you the rest. I'm sorry, okay, and I hope that we can just forget the whole thing. Okay. Bye.
Monica : Outgoing? Did that say outgoing? Not outgoing! [Monica hangs up the phone, then quickly redials.] Monica (on machine): Hi, Richard. It's Monica. Listen, I did something kind of crazy tonight. Maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Monica (in person): No!!!
Monica : I don't know.
Monica : Phoebe, we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they could change his number.
Monica : I was always Joanne.
Monica : I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. (they all stare at her) And I'm appalled for you by the way. Matress
Monica : What's the part?
Monica : Not at these prices.
Monica : (lying down on a mattress) Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Monica : (sees the bed) What's this?
Monica : This is not the bed I ordered!
Monica : Phoebe! (Phoebe makes a sound like a car screeching to a halt.)
Monica : Why is this car in my bedroom?
Monica : When did I sign for it?
Monica : Did you make brownies today?
Monica : (to Phoebe) Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
Monica : Sometimes I have bad dreams. (starts to break down, and Phoebe offers her, her hand to comfort her.) [Classroom, Joey is coaching his student.]
Monica : Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Monica : Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Monica : Hey.
Monica : How's the big anniversary dinner?
Monica : Ohhh, nice.
Monica : What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and fruit flies everywhere.)
Monica : That's okay, this is more important than fruit (pause) (angrily) on my ceiling! You broke up?!
Monica : Oh no!!
Monica : Rachel, you and Mark?!
Monica : Hey.
Monica : Oh, there's banana on it.
Monica : So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)
Monica : Oh, good. Thanks.
Monica : Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Monica : Yes! Have you seen it?
Monica : I know!!
Monica : Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Monica : Did that!
Monica : Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Monica : No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Monica : That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
Monica : Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips? [The Xerox Place, Ross is trying to break the trail.]
Monica : Ow!
Monica : Ow!! Ow!!
Monica : It's okay, it's okay.
Monica : We were just waxing our legs.
Monica : That's right. (Joey laughs, pulls it off, then does a high-pitched whine.) [Cut to Living Room, Rachel is trying to close the door on Ross.]
Monica : What?
Monica : (going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.
Monica : Oh my God.
Monica : Oh!! (hits Chandler and Joey in the head) You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
Monica : (stopping him) What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
Monica : Because they'll know we've been listening. [Cut to Living Room]
Monica : What if they don't? (Long pause.)
Monica : Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Monica : Oh, dad, turn it off.Mr.
Monica : Hey.
Monica : Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Monica : Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries. (Ross quickly directs the families to their tables.) [Scene: Chandler and Joey are standing by the kitchen entrance. A waiter comes out.]
Monica : (Looking nauseous from her parents kissing.) And I'm going to go get drunk. (Gets up to get a drink.) [Scene: An airport in New York.]
Monica : I was laughing. (Patting him on the knee.)
Monica : Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
Monica : My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. (A drunken man approaches.) I'm not going to let anything spoil that. Drunk
Monica : Well, thanks, we like him. Drunk
Monica : Then why would he say it?
Monica : Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
Monica : Ohh, Please?! I'm a single mom, with a thirty year old son!! [Scene: The airport. Rachel runs up to the ticket counter.]
Monica : (Comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not knowing what to say.) COMMERCIAL BREAK [Scene: Chandlers hotel room. Chandler and Monica are lying in the bed together talking. There's an awkward air between them. They are both clutching the covers in from of them.]
Monica : (In am uneasy voice.) Nope. (She chuckles uneasily.)
Monica : Yep, yep...You?
Monica : Well...I'd better get going.
Monica : (Scoots towards the side of the bed.) Could you not look?
Monica : Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good. Mrs.
Monica : (Angrily.) You can let some of them go by!(Judy and Andrea go to the front of the chapel. Joey approaches Monica.)
Monica : (Awkwardly.) Why would I care where Chandler is? You know uhh...You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Monica : Stupid.
Monica : What were we thinking?
Monica : Oh yeah. Definitely. (They quickly take their places and Here Comes the Bride Begins to play. Everyone seated looks back. Emily is being escorted up the aisle by her father. She kisses him on the cheek and takes her place by Ross's side.)
Monica : Hey guys!
Monica : We need to talk to you about something.
Monica : No, it's not!
Monica : Thank you, Pheebs!
Monica : What? You are way off, lady!
Monica : That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
Monica : Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
Monica : You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
Monica : No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
Monica : 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
Monica : This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"! (Monica leaves)
Monica : (Chandler's laughing) Did someone drop the baton again?
Monica : (she tastes what she has cooked) I don't get older. I just get better!
Monica : You don't know that.
Monica : Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
Monica : Name one of his books.
Monica : Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
Monica : Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
Monica : Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
Monica : Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these (she gives Chandler a bowl with cranberries. Then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) Not with soap!! (she leaves)
Monica : Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
Monica : Do you hear something? (Chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)
Monica : Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
Monica : (gasps) Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
Monica : Oh! They're late and they're sloppy! [Cut to the hall] (Rachel comes out of her apartment}
Monica : No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
Monica : (Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.
Monica : That's all the turkey you're gonna get. [cut to the hall]
Monica : Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
Monica : Stinky?!
Monica : Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
Monica : Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
Monica : (Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
Monica : Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Monica : Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Monica : Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Monica : It's too late for apologies.
Monica : The three of us? Joey: Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein! (Monica gasps and holds her forehead. Phoebe, Rachel and Ross pull back their heads)
Monica : Joey, that is not gonna work.
Monica : Alright, well, this does not change anything. (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
Monica : Bring it.
Monica : Here you go! (She squirts some of the grease along Joey's face.)
Monica : Okay, try it. (Joey tries to pull back at all his might.)
Monica : Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
Monica : Chandler, where are your tools?
Monica : I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
Monica : Oh!
Monica : Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
Monica : (very emotional) I don't care. (Chandler can't believe what he's hearing. He looks at Monica, then at the others, then back at Monica.)
Monica : That was the adoption agency...
Monica : WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
Monica : There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us! (They all cheer and Rachel, Ross and Phoebe join in for a group hug. Joey also joins, but he stands back a bit, because he is all sticky of the food on him)
Monica : This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass! (They all cheer and hug again, but Joey's eating the food off his shirt) COMMERCIAL BREAK [Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. The table is set, and there's food on the tables again. They're all there, toasting.]
Monica : I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. (she kisses Chandler)

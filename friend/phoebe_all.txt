Phoebe : Wait, does he eat chalk? (THE OTHERS STARE, BEMUSED)
Phoebe : Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Phoebe : No.
Phoebe : Ooh! Oh! (STARTS TO PLUCK AT THE AIR JUST IN FRONT OF Ross)
Phoebe : (SINGS) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica TURN TO LOOK AT HER)..bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...
Phoebe : (GRINS and WALKS TO KITCHEN. TO Chandler and Joey) I helped!
Phoebe : Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Phoebe : Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to. (AD BREAK) SCENE 3: Ross' APARTMENT (THE GUYS ARE ASSEMBLING FURNITURE)
Phoebe : All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (SHE MASSAGES THEM)
Phoebe : Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Phoebe : You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, clea ning windows outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. (A PAUSE)
Phoebe : (SINGS) I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
Phoebe : (SINGS) What I said...
Phoebe : Oh, was I doing it again?
Phoebe : Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Phoebe : (WAKING and STARTLING THEM) Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
Phoebe : I got no sleep last night!
Phoebe : My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
Phoebe : Thanks. (ENTER Chandler and Joey. Joey IS COUNTING HIS STEPS)
Phoebe : I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
Phoebe : I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Phoebe : (TO Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (THEY SCREAM) SCENE 2: THE BOYS WALKING DOWN A STREET (Chandler and Joey ARE KICKING A CAN ABOUT)
Phoebe : Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Phoebe : You are just like Jack.
Phoebe : No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Phoebe : Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
Phoebe : Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
Phoebe : Floopy?
Phoebe : Oh, like that's a word.
Phoebe : Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Phoebe : What?
Phoebe : I don't even have a 'pl'. Pizza
Phoebe : And-and a power tie? Pizza
Phoebe : Big Bird's friend.
Phoebe : Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (RUNS UP and TAKES THE BINOCULARS)
Phoebe : Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Phoebe : Definitely not his mother.
Phoebe : Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (YELLS) Hey, that's not for you, bitch! (Phoebe COVERS HER MOUTH WITH HER Hand and WALKS AWAY FROM THE WINDOW) (CUT TO THE HOSPITAL. Joey IS MIMING HOCKEY PUCKS HITTING FOREHEADS. Chandler REALISES IT'S GETTING TENSE and GOES TO THE RECEPTIONIST AGAIN)
Phoebe : Yeah?
Phoebe : Uh-huh.
Phoebe : Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
Phoebe : You'd already broken up.
Phoebe : A couple hours.
Phoebe : There he is! There he is!
Phoebe : Right- where we've been looking all night!
Phoebe : Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care. [Long pause.]
Phoebe : You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Phoebe : No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Phoebe : Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Phoebe : [to Rachel] What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Phoebe : [rhythmically] Uh-huh, uh-huh. [Angela, a beautiful woman in a tight dress, enters.]
Phoebe : Are you gonna go over there?
Phoebe : This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
Phoebe : Eww, I don't wanna do that. [Janice and Phoebe's boyfriend, Tony, walk in.]
Phoebe : Ok, have a good break-up.
Phoebe : Yeah, it was really hard.
Phoebe : Ok, you weren't there. Scene: The Launderama. [ Rachel is there, waiting for Ross. An old woman takes Rachel's clothes off the machine and begins loading it with her things.]
Phoebe : Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed. [Chandler walks back to couch, where Janice is.]
Phoebe : Oh my god. [Chandler downs another espresso.] How many of those have you had?
Phoebe : Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
Phoebe : All right. [Janice returns from the bathroom.]
Phoebe : Wait here. Breathe. [Phoebe goes over to speak to Janice. She talks to her for a few seconds, and then Janice immediately smiles, hugs her, waves to Chandler, and leaves.]
Phoebe : It's like a gift.
Phoebe : Oh, I'd like that. Scene: The Launderama. [ Rachel is sorting her now-pink clothes.]
Phoebe : [seeing Rachel's clothes] What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this. [Monica and Joey enter.]
Phoebe : Hey, how'd it go?
Phoebe : Oh, he needed some time to grieve. [Chandler runs by the window outside, joyous.]
Phoebe : The exclamation point in the title scares me. (GESTURING) Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud! (THE LIGHTS DIM)
Phoebe : Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
Phoebe : Based on this play? ...Based on this play! SCENE 2: Central Perk (ENTER Chandler; EVERYONE ELSE IS ALREADY THERE)
Phoebe : (READING Monica'S PALM) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Phoebe : Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Phoebe : (TO Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
Phoebe : Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, (PSYCHO) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
Phoebe : Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! (ENTER Joey ON THE PHONE)
Phoebe : Seriously, what-what's the part?
Phoebe : No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Phoebe : Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. [plays a chord, then the lights go out] OK, thank you very much. [Scene: The ATM vestibule of a bank. Chandler is inside. The lights go out, and he realizes he is trapped inside.]
Phoebe : Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. [to Monica] What's my number? [Monica and Rachel look at Phoebe strangely.]
Phoebe : Well, I never call me. Scene: ATM vestibule. [ Jill Goodacre is on the cellular phone. Chandler's thoughts are in italics.]
Phoebe : [at window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles. [They all look at the window, grossed out, then flinch in pain.]
Phoebe : Oh... Milwaukee.
Phoebe : Oh, Rachel.
Phoebe : [singing] New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... [she writes the lyrics down]
Phoebe : About what?
Phoebe : What surprise party?
Phoebe : Well, he didn't tell me.
Phoebe : This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Phoebe : Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. [Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased] Looks like I was second to last. Scene: The infamous balcony. [ Ross and Rachel are talking.]
Phoebe : Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Phoebe : [stops at a door] Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Phoebe : [trying to hold back the struggling cat] He seems to hate you. Are you sure? Mr.
Phoebe : Wait a minute. What's his name? Mr.
Phoebe : [the cat runs away from her] Oooh! You are a very bad man! Mr.
Phoebe : Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Phoebe : Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Phoebe : [smiling] You betcha! Scene: ATM vestibule.
Phoebe : I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. [Rachel looks at her] But I won't.
Phoebe : You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... [they stare at her]... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Phoebe : Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... [time lapse]... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... [someone blows it out, the room gets completely dark]
Phoebe : Thanks.
Phoebe : Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Phoebe : I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Phoebe : Yeah, you have homosexual hair. [Enter Monica and Ross]
Phoebe : Oh, that sucks!
Phoebe : Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
Phoebe : Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? [She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously] Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
Phoebe : Thanks!
Phoebe : Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. [Hands back the pencil] Scene 4: Nana's house. [ Ross, Mrs. Geller and Aunt Lillian are going through clothes]
Phoebe : [Entering] Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
Phoebe : What'd I say?
Phoebe : God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
Phoebe : Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
Phoebe : You missed a belt loop.
Phoebe : Okay, it's in spasm. Mrs. Geller: Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. [Hands Ross a bottle of pills. Then turns to Monica and pats her hair over her ears] [Cut to Chandler and a woman, Andrea, reaching for the same slice of meat]
Phoebe : Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
Phoebe : Ooh! That's so nice...
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : What were you modeling for?
Phoebe : You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Phoebe : Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
Phoebe : Yeah. Oh, can I come?
Phoebe : Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Phoebe : Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Phoebe : No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious. [Scene: Monica's apartment. Joey enters, upset.]
Phoebe : Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
Phoebe : [stirring pot] Ok, all done.
Phoebe : Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Phoebe : Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Phoebe : Almost never.
Phoebe : Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
Phoebe : Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys. [Short pause.]
Phoebe : Ooh.
Phoebe : Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal. [They all run to the window.]
Phoebe : It's nice that he has someone. [Time lapse. The gang is around the table, eating grilled cheese sandwiches.]
Phoebe : Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Phoebe : Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
Phoebe : That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Phoebe : So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
Phoebe : Yeah, you wish!
Phoebe : Oh, oh, good.
Phoebe : [Takes mike] Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. [Shakes bell as an introduction] [Sung:] I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? [shakes bell] La lalala la la la la lalala la la... [Cut to later. Everyone is totally depressed by now.]
Phoebe : [Sung] ...My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy... [Over the sound of Phoebe singing we hear two scientists, Max and David, having a noisy discussion]
Phoebe : [Sung] ...I feel a little sneezy And now I- [abruptly stops] Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! [They stop talking and look up] Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group? Max: No. No, that's- that's okay.
Phoebe : Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
Phoebe : Could you speak up please? David: [Stands up and speaks more loudly] Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought Max: Daryl Hannah. David: Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a Max: Hard quality. David: -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. [Sits down]
Phoebe : Okay, we're gonna take a short break. [Goes over to their table]
Phoebe : David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Phoebe : Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Phoebe : Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Phoebe : No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Phoebe : Okay, alright, I have a question, then. David: Yuh.
Phoebe : Um, were you planning on kissing me ever? David: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be [Writes YES on the board] yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.
Phoebe : Sure. David: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.
Phoebe : Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body. David: Rrrreally.
Phoebe : Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me. David: ...Now? Now?
Phoebe : Oh yeah, right now. David: Okay, okay, okay. [Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop computer] Y'know what, this was just really expensive. [Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks up a microscope] And I'll take- this was a gift. [Moves it]
Phoebe : Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. David: Okay, what the hell, what the hell. [Sweeps the remaining papers off the desk and grabs Phoebe] You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?
Phoebe : I can hop. [She hops onto the table] [They kiss, finally] [Scene 4: Central Perk]
Phoebe : Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody? Max: No. Have you seen David?
Phoebe : No, no, he hasn't been around. Max: Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
Phoebe : Minsk? Max: Minsk. It's in Russia.
Phoebe : I know where Minsk is. Max: We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
Phoebe : So when, when do you leave? Max: January first. [Commercial] [Scene 5: Max and David's lab. They are working. Phoebe knocks on the door]
Phoebe : Hello? David: Hey!
Phoebe : Hi. David: Hi! [Kisses her] What-what're you doing here?
Phoebe : Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so [Puts on a fake cheery voice] congratulations! This is so exciting! Max: It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Phoebe : Oh, you're not going? [Fake disappointed voice] Oh, why? Max: Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' [Storms out] David: Thank you, Max. Thank you.
Phoebe : So-so you're really not going? David: I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
Phoebe : Oh don't do that. David: Please.
Phoebe : Oh no no. David: No, but I'm asking-
Phoebe : Oh, but I can't do that- David: No, but I can't-
Phoebe : It's your thing, and- David: -make the decision-
Phoebe : Okay, um, stay. David: Stay.
Phoebe : Stay. [He thinks for a moment and sweeps the stuff off the table]
Phoebe : Getting so good at that! [She hops on] David: It was Max's stuff. [They kiss] [Scene 6: Mon+Rach's- the party] Janice: I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! [Laughs her Janice laugh]
Phoebe : And then... your face is bloated?
Phoebe : Hi, Max! Max: Yoko. [To David] I've decided to go to Minsk without you. David: Wow. Max: It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.[Walks off]
Phoebe : Are you alright? David: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. [Phoebe leads David into a bedroom]
Phoebe : You're going to Minsk. David: No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
Phoebe : Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me. David: Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
Phoebe : Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say [Hits him] 'no! No! I can't understand that!'. David: Uh, ow.
Phoebe : Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. [He does so] And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me. David: I'll never forget you.
Phoebe : And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. [They kiss] I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy. Dick Clark (TV): Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square... [Joey puts a blanket over Sandy's kids]
Phoebe : Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
Phoebe : I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
Phoebe : Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Phoebe : Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Phoebe : Where? [Turns to face him] Ooh, come to Momma.
Phoebe : We should do something. Whistle.
Phoebe : Come on, do it.
Phoebe : Do it!
Phoebe : Do it do it do it!

Phoebe : I just wish there was something we could do. [Bends down and talks to him] Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Phoebe : Maybe nobody's tried this.
Phoebe : Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Phoebe : Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Phoebe : I know. [Scene 2: Mon+Rach's]
Phoebe : Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.

Phoebe : Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. [Monica gives her a look] 'Kay. [Sung:] You don't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say... [She sees Monica sneaking out] Okay, thank you very much, I'm gonna take a short break! [Runs out, knocking over the mike stand]
Phoebe : Alright, whadyou do with him? [There is the sound of a flushing toilet and Coma Guy emerges from the bathroom]

Phoebe : You're welcome. Coma Guy: So. I guess I'll see you around.
Phoebe : What, that's it?
Phoebe : I don't think you mean that.
Phoebe : Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma. [Scene 8: Chandler and Joey's. Chandler is talking with his mom] Mrs. Bing: Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?

One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. [Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie] Rachel [taking cookie]: Ok, thanks Pheebs [takes bite of cookie, overwhelmed] Oh my God,
Phoebe : I know.
Phoebe : Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies

Phoebe : You ok?
Phoebe : Yep!
Phoebe : Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower. Roger: That's pretty much it.

Phoebe : So what's going on?
Phoebe : Nothing, nothing. Roger: Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. [Pats his leg. She lies down and rests her head in his lap]
Phoebe : It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't. Roger: Oh. They don't.
Phoebe : But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little... Roger: What?
Phoebe : Intense and creepy. Roger: Oh.
Phoebe : But I don't. Me, Phoebe. Roger: Well, I'm not- I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
Phoebe : You're not? See, that's why you're so great! Roger: Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'. [Cut to Monica and Rachel's]
Phoebe : Hey. All: Hey, Pheebs.
Phoebe : Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger. All: Awww.
Phoebe : Yeah, right. All: Aaawwwwww!!
Phoebe : I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy! [Closing credits] [Credits scene: Monica and Rachel's. Phoebe is reading the paper and Joey enters]
Phoebe : Hey, Joey. What's going on?
Phoebe : 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
Phoebe : I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
Phoebe : Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Phoebe : Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Phoebe : Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Phoebe : Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Phoebe : Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
Phoebe : Um, that's ok! [throws it in fire] Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
Phoebe : Ok, yeah, ok. [she throws the directions in] Oh, OK.
Phoebe : Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
Phoebe : See, there you go, the cleansing works!
Phoebe : Hey guys, guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know... [Chandler comes in.]
Phoebe : Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
Phoebe : So was it a lot more money?
Phoebe : Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? [pause] Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
Phoebe : Hi! [turns back to Chandler, then to Monica] Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
Phoebe : Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
Phoebe : Yeah, I know! [turns to Chandler] Well, what do you think?
Phoebe : OK. [pause] Hey Monica! Guess what! [Scene: Monica's apartment. Chandler walks in, wearing a suit.]
Phoebe : Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Phoebe : Ooh! Brian's Song!
Phoebe : [as though Rachel wasn't paying attention] Yummy noises.
Phoebe : Ooh! I know what you could make! [runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen] I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. [sits down]
Phoebe : Oh, is this the bug lady?
Phoebe : That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Phoebe : [excited] Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Phoebe : Oh! You have a window!
Phoebe : Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Phoebe : [sitting] OK.
Phoebe : [overemphasizing] Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of [Monica signals her to stop] of, OK, smells.
Phoebe : [whispers] In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
Phoebe : Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
Phoebe : Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
Phoebe : You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
Phoebe : How's this? [presses down hard]
Phoebe : How about over here? [presses down hard again]
Phoebe : See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? [presses down elsewhere]
Phoebe : Ooh! Oh! Fun! Ok. Um, Liam Neeson.
Phoebe : Morly Safer.
Phoebe : The woman who cuts my hair!
Phoebe : Oh, really.
Phoebe : Riff's. Yeah, I know.
Phoebe : Hmmm? Uh, yeah. So, uh, is she fat?
Phoebe : Where were you standing?
Phoebe : It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know. Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it, later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new"?
Phoebe : Why? Why would you wanna do that? Why?
Phoebe : Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and uh, I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but you know, we've grown apart. So, uh, I don't know. Why not?
Phoebe : Yeah I'm fine.
Phoebe : Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Phoebe : Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Phoebe : Yeah?
Phoebe : Right, and it's me.
Phoebe : Much as you are.
Phoebe : Oh, that's good.
Phoebe : Good choice.
Phoebe : Oh, my first birthday present. Oh, this is really--
Phoebe : Oh, sure, yeah. Ok, it fits.
Phoebe : That you like. We get it. You like her. Great.
Phoebe : All right, well, maybe now it's not ok.
Phoebe : Ok.
Phoebe : Where're you going?
Phoebe : With?
Phoebe : All right, could I just ask you one question? Have you two, you know...like, you know, you know, yet?
Phoebe : All right, so, can we turn this off? Just, just make it--make them go away? I can't, I can't look.
Phoebe : Yeah. Yeah. It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing.
Phoebe : Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything. She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. Oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like, have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend? Monica &
Phoebe : Well, but that's what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then broke his heart, and then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore. Because he said he didn't wanna be around anything that looked like either one of us. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but--
Phoebe : Yeah.
Phoebe : But he's falling in love with her.
Phoebe : Ok. Oh, ok, oh.
Phoebe : Hey, what's going on?
Phoebe : Oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room. Where's Joey?
Phoebe : Hi. Trouble?
Phoebe : Oh, no. Don't you just hate it when people aren't there for you?
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : Um, you, got a minute?
Phoebe : So.
Phoebe : Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
Phoebe : Right, like the kind you--
Phoebe : How'd you know I was coming?
Phoebe : I can't believe you did this. I can't believe you--did this. So, what's the deal with uh you and Joey?
Phoebe : Does he know?
Phoebe : Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
Phoebe : You got me.
Phoebe : So, um, are you gonna call him?
Phoebe : No. Joey.
Phoebe : No. No food with a face.
Phoebe : Yeah, you too.
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : Listen, um.
Phoebe : I'm sorry.
Phoebe : Yeah, um, you know, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk.
Phoebe : That's right, I don't, but I was, I was drunk on you.
Phoebe : Ok, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
Phoebe : If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
Phoebe : Um, then yes, 'cause of Phoebe. So, you know, it's either her or me.
Phoebe : You know, you're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
Phoebe : Really? (kiss)
Phoebe : Yeah.
Phoebe : Is he all right?
Phoebe : [reading]: Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh... [crumples up letter]
Phoebe : Wow!
Phoebe : [reading]: Your Visa bill is huge!
Phoebe : What?
Phoebe : Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?
Phoebe : Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?
Phoebe : Congratulations! [Microwave timer goes off. Monica gets up.]
Phoebe : OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
Phoebe : But... I'm ready, so, just deal.
Phoebe : [to Joey]: Oh I see, so then, you were lying.
Phoebe : About how good your cards were.
Phoebe : A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
Phoebe : OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready.
Phoebe : Ha. Ha, ha.
Phoebe : Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.
Phoebe : Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home.
Phoebe : Thank y-- [thinks about it]
Phoebe : Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?
Phoebe : Alright, here's my $7.50. [hands them the money] But I think you should know that this money is cursed.
Phoebe : Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.
Phoebe : [holding a card and waving it in front of her face] Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go. [they look at her] Right, OK, serious poker. [Ross gets up from the table.]
Phoebe : [looks at her cards] Yes! [everyone looks at her] .... or no. [Ross comes back from bathroom.]
Phoebe : You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Phoebe : Yeah. Um... I'm out. [throws in cards]
Phoebe : Monica, in or out?
Phoebe : OK Joey, your bet.
Phoebe : Ross?
Phoebe : Chandler?
Phoebe : Me too. Rachel.
Phoebe : Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants. [Ross is visibly upset.]
Phoebe : Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff.
Phoebe : I'm in.
Phoebe : ...teen! [throws in a ten-dollar bill] [Ross looks in his wallet, pulls out two dollars.]
Phoebe : That's a bird? [Monica glares at Phoebe.]
Phoebe : That's a bird! [Monica sits, Rachel gets up.]
Phoebe : So good!
Phoebe : I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
Phoebe : Hugh! Hugh Grant!
Phoebe : [Entering] Hey. All: Hi.
Phoebe : Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
Phoebe : Oh no, how?
Phoebe : Which one?
Phoebe : No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
Phoebe : Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall? Mr. Heckles: I wasn't ready for it.
Phoebe : Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. [They move off] Mr. Heckles: You owe me a waffle.
Phoebe : Oh, is that who the monkey's named after? Luisa: Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
Phoebe : Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
Phoebe : Yes, but there isn't always time!
Phoebe : Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry. [Cut to another part of the building. We see Marcel jump in through a window and run down some stairs, then Chandler and Joey come down from the upper floor without noticing]
Phoebe : Marcel?
Phoebe : Marcel? Both: Marcel?
Phoebe : OhmyGod!
Phoebe : Something just brushed up against my right leg!
Phoebe : Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg. [Marcel makes a monkeyish noise- he is sitting in the corner]
Phoebe : Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere! [Luisa appears on the stairs] Luisa: Step aside, ladies! [She loads a gun]
Phoebe : Yeah, think so. Oh! [She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it] Huh. [Sways back] Whoah.
Phoebe : Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea. [Mr. Heckles opens the door]
Phoebe : Nope.
Phoebe : How can people do that?... (All BUT Phoebe WALK AWAY FROM THE WINDOW IN DISGUST) Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots! OPENING TITLES SCENE 1: Central Perk (All PRESENT EXCEPT Rachel)
Phoebe : Oh, God, just do it! (GETTING PHONE) Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Phoebe : So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Phoebe : Okay, they're just talking...
Phoebe : No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
Phoebe : That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! (ENTER Rachel) Oh!
Phoebe : Not a good day for birds...
Phoebe : Oh my God! (WALKS TO WINDOW) Go away! (GESTICULATING) Stop looking in here!
Phoebe : You cook naked?
Phoebe : Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Phoebe : How many beeps?
Phoebe : How'd he take it?
Phoebe : Sex in his chair.
Phoebe : Where are you going?
Phoebe : Radiator.
Phoebe : Rdtor.
Phoebe : You know he's gay?
Phoebe : Whoo-hoo!
Phoebe : Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! [Points to a lamp which is shaking behind the sofa]
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : What are you doing?
Phoebe : This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, Monica, DON'T DO IT!! ...Thank you. [Scene 4: Tap class. The girls are standing at the door]
Phoebe : Lotsa things. [They go in and sit down]
Phoebe : I think she means [Imitates] 'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. [They put on some spare shoes]
Phoebe : [Dancing in a swirly, Phoebe kind of way] I'm totally getting it!
Phoebe : Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Phoebe : Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
Phoebe : Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke. [Scene 6: Monica and Rachel's. Mon, Rach and Fake Monica are there]
Phoebe : I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Phoebe : ...Flame Boy. [Scene 8: Central Perk. Ross is talking to Dr. Baldhara, a zookeeper]
Phoebe : Okay. Goodbye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the 'plane.
Phoebe : Oh!
Phoebe : Tell him, tell him.
Phoebe : Doing it on this table. [points at the table]
Phoebe : [points at Joey?s pen] Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Phoebe : Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
Phoebe : No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop". And they are.
Phoebe : What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Phoebe : I could be a secretary.
Phoebe : I could do that. [Ross?s beeper goes off]
Phoebe : Well, maybe 25-26.
Phoebe : There you go. [Scene: Chandler?s office. He and Phoebe are there when the phone starts ringing.]
Phoebe : [plays with a thumbtack remover] Yeah?
Phoebe : Oh. Uh, I?m on. [picks up the phone]
Phoebe : [with a deep voice] Mr. Bing?s office. No I?m sorry, he?s in a meeting right now.
Phoebe : Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I?ll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Phoebe : Ross says hi.
Phoebe : This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Phoebe : Most likely. [raises and goes toward the door] Okay, I?m gonna be out there.
Phoebe : All right. Bye bye.
Phoebe : Whatcha doin??
Phoebe : Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
Phoebe : No, I didn?t tell anybody that I knew you.
Phoebe : Oh, because, you know... they don?t like you.
Phoebe : I thought you knew that.
Phoebe : Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
Phoebe : Don?t feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you?re like "Mr. Boss Man". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, "Boss Man Bing". [Joey and Ross laughs]
Phoebe : Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
Phoebe : You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?' [Joey and Ross laughs]
Phoebe : That is so sweet, you guys. [hugs them] [Monica enters, wearing a walkman, so she doesn?t hear what the others say] Ross, Rachel &
Phoebe : Hey, Mon.
Phoebe : Ooh, oh, I?ve gotta go. [raises] Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. [sits down, and then raises again] Cool!
Phoebe : Um, oh, I?ve got a birthday party, with some work people.
Phoebe : No, I know. That?s a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravagance.
Phoebe : Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Phoebe : I really do, yeah.
Phoebe : Okay.
Phoebe : Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don?t wanna be the geek that invited the boss. [Scene: Chandler?s office. He and Phoebe are taking a break from work.]
Phoebe : You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Phoebe : You know, now you?re more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss", "Mr.", you know, "I?m one of you, Boss", "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing"
Phoebe : Well, you know what Chandler? I think you?ve gotta face it. You?re like, the guy in the big office, you know. You?re the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you?re a great boss.
Phoebe : Uh huh. But they?re not your friends anymore.
Phoebe : No, but you can?t.
Phoebe : Uh uh. [Scene: Central Perk. Everyone exept Phoebe and Chandler is there. Ross?s beeper goes off and everyone exept him react.]
Phoebe : Petrie.
Phoebe : Did I miss it, did I miss it?
Phoebe : I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical. [Carol and Susan arrive.]
Phoebe : (singing) They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry... [Ross gives Phoebe a dollar.]
Phoebe : Thanks, Ross.
Phoebe : Ok. [A woman passes by, carrying newborn twins.]
Phoebe : Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Phoebe : Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.
Phoebe : Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Phoebe : Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this. [Phoebe goes to leave the room, but the door is locked.]
Phoebe : Ok, who wants to hear something ironic? Commercial Break [Scene: The broom closet. Ross and Susan are trying to get out.]
Phoebe : (singing) They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next...[sees Ross and Susan staring at her] la la la la la la.
Phoebe : This is so great.
Phoebe : I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. [pause] I'm sorry, you were fighting. [Scene: Carol's room. She is ready to give birth. Everyone is there except for Phoebe, Ross, and Susan, who are in the broom closet.]
Phoebe : [reading the nametag on the uniform] Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Phoebe : Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent. [A janitor opens the closet door from the outside.]
Phoebe : You guys, he's beautiful!
Phoebe : Susan, he looks just like you.
Phoebe : Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. [screen goes blank] Look, he's opening his eyes. [picture comes back]
Phoebe : Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Phoebe : Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist! Credits [Scene: Monica's apartment. Monica and Phoebe are preparing for a barbecue for Rachel's birthday.]
Phoebe : We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... [hands meat to Monica] [Chandler and Joey enter with charcoal.]
Phoebe : So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your [provocatively] special someone?
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Phoebe : Jeez, you say one thing, and...
Phoebe : Oh, let me see! [takes the picture]
Phoebe : Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... [puts picture down, sees Ross staring at her] Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Phoebe : Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the--
Phoebe : So you do know who he is! [laughs, Ross stares at her] Sorry.
Phoebe : Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story. [Ross goes outisde on the balcony.]
Phoebe : Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Phoebe : Remembered what?
Phoebe : Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Phoebe : I know. This is really, really huge.
Phoebe : Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
Phoebe : Here, look, alright, does this help? [Phoebe gets up, holds the picture of Ross up to her face.]
Phoebe : Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Phoebe : No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Phoebe : Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Phoebe : Maybe there's someone else.
Phoebe : Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
Phoebe : Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
Phoebe : Yes.
Phoebe : 'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Phoebe : Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
Phoebe : All right, so what were you thinking?
Phoebe : Oh. No.
Phoebe : Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
Phoebe : I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings. Phone rings
Phoebe : I'm still on "no".
Phoebe : What's goin' on?
Phoebe : Ewww!
Phoebe : Where?
Phoebe : Hey, hey Ross.
Phoebe : Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Phoebe : All right. Ok, but, but you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
Phoebe : All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
Phoebe : All right, that's it, I quit.
Phoebe : Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
Phoebe : Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
Phoebe : Demi Moore.
Phoebe : Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
Phoebe : Oh, oh, oh my god!
Phoebe : I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
Phoebe : Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
Phoebe : It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
Phoebe : I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Phoebe : Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, you come on in.
Phoebe : Thank you.
Phoebe : You wanna do it right now?
Phoebe : Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andy McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Phoebe : Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
Phoebe : Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my god, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
Phoebe : I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Phoebe : Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Phoebe : Woof, woof.
Phoebe : What?
Phoebe : Oh, all right. What did I have?
Phoebe : Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Phoebe : I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
Phoebe : Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
Phoebe : Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
Phoebe : Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Phoebe : Ben, dinner!
Phoebe : Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
Phoebe : I licked my arm, what?
Phoebe : So?
Phoebe : You won't even taste it?
Phoebe : Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Phoebe : Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
Phoebe : Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Phoebe : You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
Phoebe : Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Phoebe : You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
Phoebe : I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Phoebe : Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
Phoebe : I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
Phoebe : Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
Phoebe : Nah. Not really.
Phoebe : I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Phoebe : Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Phoebe : Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
Phoebe : Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed. (knock)
Phoebe : Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Phoebe : Really? You can actually see it?
Phoebe : See, I didn't know that.
Phoebe : Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Phoebe : Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Phoebe : Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
Phoebe : What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Phoebe : He's even kind of cute.
Phoebe : I'd call that excessive.
Phoebe : Janice? You called Janice?
Phoebe : Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Phoebe : Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
Phoebe : Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
Phoebe : I can't believe you caved.
Phoebe : You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
Phoebe : Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
Phoebe : Uh huh. Why is that?
Phoebe : Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
Phoebe : You're there!
Phoebe : Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
Phoebe : It's Ross.
Phoebe : Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Phoebe : Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
Phoebe : Let's see!
Phoebe : Wow, look at these prices.
Phoebe : Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
Phoebe : No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
Phoebe : I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
Phoebe : Not for you.
Phoebe : Fine. All right, fine.
Phoebe : Well, then...Let's.
Phoebe : No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
Phoebe : Yeah.
Phoebe : Oh, it's like a skit.
Phoebe : Cool.
Phoebe : So...Thank you.
Phoebe : Actually, it makes us feel that big.
Phoebe : I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Phoebe : Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Phoebe : Fine.
Phoebe : Ok. One.
Phoebe : We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
Phoebe : Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
Phoebe : Oh. (Everyone goes over to comfort Monica)
Phoebe : No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Phoebe : No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Phoebe : Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. [hugs Chandler but holds her hands apart behind his back] Oh, can't make.... hands... meet.... OPENING TITLES [Scene: Hallway between the apartments. Chandler comes out wearing spandex, jogging in place. Monica is there.]
Phoebe : Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
Phoebe : Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.
Phoebe : Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?
Phoebe : No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
Phoebe : Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.
Phoebe : No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell. [Monica enters.]
Phoebe : [seeing Ross kissing Julie outside the window] Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.
Phoebe : So, I figured it out.
Phoebe : Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
Phoebe : Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
Phoebe : You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. [they hug] [Outside the window, Monica and Chandler jog up. Monica playfully pushes him. They start puching and slapping harder and harder until Monica pushes him down. Chandler stands up, with a serious expression, and chases her away.] [Scene: Back in the restraunt. Rachel pours the last of the champange bottle in her glass.]
Phoebe : Hey Joey.
Phoebe : How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
Phoebe : So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.
Phoebe : And we did.
Phoebe : Yay me.
Phoebe : Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
Phoebe : He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.
Phoebe : Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking... I convinced him.
Phoebe : Um-hum.
Phoebe : Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Phoebe : Oh.
Phoebe : Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Phoebe : Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
Phoebe : Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Phoebe : Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
Phoebe : Oh, well, actually.
Phoebe : Ok, all right.
Phoebe : Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night". [Ross and Rachel look at each other and then at Phoebe, realizing the song is about their situation.]
Phoebe : [singing] There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide! [Scene: Mr. Ratstatter's office. Monica is there about a job.] Mr.
Phoebe : It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
Phoebe : What makes it pilgrim?
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : No offense, but that sounds nothing like her. [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Ross is up in arms about the Rachel/Julie situation.]
Phoebe : Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like! [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler is on the phone with a computer hotline.]
Phoebe : I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
Phoebe : What?
Phoebe : What were you thinking?
Phoebe : Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting on the couch, eating candy. It is raining out. Ross climbs up the fire escape and is knocking on the window.]
Phoebe : Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls. [Chandler and Joey enter.]
Phoebe : I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
Phoebe : Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : Happy Christmas Eve Eve. [sees Ross's picture frame] Oh my God, where did you get this?
Phoebe : This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
Phoebe : No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
Phoebe : No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
Phoebe : [showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
Phoebe : It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]
Phoebe : Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Phoebe : Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Phoebe : Just, you know, to see... um.
Phoebe : OK, is this really my father?
Phoebe : OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
Phoebe : Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
Phoebe : Oh God.
Phoebe : Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Phoebe : OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Phoebe : [realizes] Oh.
Phoebe : Oh. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel, Chandler, and Joey are decorating the Christmas tree.]
Phoebe : Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information. [hangs up] [Phoebe's grandmother enters]
Phoebe : Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
Phoebe : Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
Phoebe : No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
Phoebe : Whattaya mean?
Phoebe : Wow. Thank you.
Phoebe : Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! [blows a kiss to a picture of Einstein] Commercial [Scene: Chandler is standing on a street corner waiting for Phoebe in the cab. Joey walks up.]
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
Phoebe : OK, let's go.
Phoebe : Alright, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]
Phoebe : Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
Phoebe : Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. [Chandler jumps out of the car]
Phoebe : Ooh, this is it, 74. [screeches to a halt, Joey and Chandler are thrown into the plexiglass wall in the cab]
Phoebe : Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.
Phoebe : OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.
Phoebe : OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'. [she just sits in the cab] [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. They are having their party. All the guests are stripped down because of the heat.]
Phoebe : OK.
Phoebe : Mailbox.
Phoebe : Uh-huh.
Phoebe : No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .
Phoebe : Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
Phoebe : Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
Phoebe : Yeah?
Phoebe : You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
Phoebe : Oh, I couldn't go in.
Phoebe : Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Phoebe : Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Phoebe : You guuuyys.
Phoebe : Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.
Phoebe : OK. [reading] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...
Phoebe : Are... are you OK?
Phoebe : Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better. Fun
Phoebe : Fun Bobby is so great.
Phoebe : Half full of looooovvvvve.
Phoebe : Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
Phoebe : Two.
Phoebe : Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
Phoebe : Um, cake.
Phoebe : [comes back to couch, with cake] Sooo, what's goin' on, huh? Fun
Phoebe : [sad] Ooohh, why? [Chandler and Joey enter.]
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
Phoebe : Oh, no.
Phoebe : Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
Phoebe : Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Phoebe : But you guys came so close.
Phoebe : That is funny. Fun
Phoebe : It's not that bad.
Phoebe : OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
Phoebe : Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free. [Russ enters, walking in behind Chandler.]
Phoebe : Rachel? Um, hi.
Phoebe : OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?
Phoebe : Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
Phoebe : [looks at Russ] Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh. [Phoebe turns back around but Rachel is gone. Ross enters.]
Phoebe : Oh, my, oh!
Phoebe : I, OK....
Phoebe : Bye. [Russ and Rachel leave together.]
Phoebe : You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
Phoebe : OK honey, you're dating Ross.
Phoebe : Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
Phoebe : OK, noone is named Sleeve.
Phoebe : What's with all the bottles of liquor?
Phoebe : So... and?
Phoebe : Hi.
Phoebe : Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.
Phoebe : Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
Phoebe : Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
Phoebe : Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Phoebe : Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
Phoebe : Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
Phoebe : I think it went into me. [Everyone takes a step back from Phoebe] [Central Perk]
Phoebe : [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Phoebe : I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Sit up! Mrs.
Phoebe : I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
Phoebe : I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales? [at Rachel and Monica's] Mrs
Phoebe : [Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.
Phoebe : That's him.
Phoebe : Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me. Mr.
Phoebe : Um, do you wanna sit? Mr.
Phoebe : I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me. Mr.
Phoebe : Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around? Mr.
Phoebe : Everything? Mr.
Phoebe : Whoa, that's a lot of stuff. Mr.
Phoebe : I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head. Mr.
Phoebe : [enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Phoebe : Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh, such a pretty face. Mrs.
Phoebe : Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
Phoebe : Sir! No sir!
Phoebe : [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later. [Monica pushes Ben down the aisle in a stroller. Susan is escorted by both her parents. Carol is escorted by Ross.]
Phoebe : [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! [Phoebe's voice] Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go. [At the reception, Monica and Ross watch Carol and Susan getting their picture taken.]
Phoebe : I miss Rose.
Phoebe : I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
Phoebe : Ok, that's so nice. [Chandler tries to warn Phoebe that the woman is coming on to her, but Phoebe doesn't see him.]
Phoebe : Yeah, me, too, technically.
Phoebe : I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
Phoebe : Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
Phoebe : Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now. [Everyone laughs]
Phoebe : I know, I know. [to Rob] Hello.
Phoebe : Hi Rob Dohnen.
Phoebe : Oh, wow.
Phoebe : Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them. [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler and Joey are standing around in the kitchen.]
Phoebe : I know.
Phoebe : No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
Phoebe : I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
Phoebe : OK. [they kiss] OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
Phoebe : OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. [singing] Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is she died and some day you will too. La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la... [Scene: A nice restraunt. Joey and Erica are dining.]
Phoebe : [singing] There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you. . . But don't. Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody That's another thing that you don't wanna do.
Phoebe : Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
Phoebe : Yay, I rock.
Phoebe : But.
Phoebe : I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
Phoebe : I can do that.

I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets howsmelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
Phoebe : Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go. [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Ross is on the phone.]
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video.
Phoebe : Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video. [puts the tape in] OK. [The video is a very dramatic episode with an obviously dubbed voice for Phoebe. Everyone watches in disbeliefe]
Phoebe : Oh my God.
Phoebe : I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear.
Phoebe : Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented. [Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment. Joey stops by. Chandler is reading the paper and Eddie is fixing eggs.]
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.
Phoebe : Yes.
Phoebe : Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
Phoebe : Well, I can't work with people who would do this.
Phoebe : I mean this poor woman.
Phoebe : The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.
Phoebe : Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those animals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels. [Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment.]
Phoebe : [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.
Phoebe : Monica.
Phoebe : Chandler.
Phoebe : Rachel.
Phoebe : No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Phoebe : Why don't you play with your roommate?
Phoebe : Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
Phoebe : Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
Phoebe : Oh yeah, it'll be fun. [throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door]
Phoebe : Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
Phoebe : Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
Phoebe : I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. [leaves]
Phoebe : And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.
Phoebe : I know.
Phoebe : Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
Phoebe : Ok.
Phoebe : Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Phoebe : Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
Phoebe : Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Phoebe : Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
Phoebe : Why would you kill his fish?
Phoebe : Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
Phoebe : But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
Phoebe : Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?
Phoebe : Didn't it like totally speak to you?
Phoebe : Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.
Phoebe : Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
Phoebe : Yeah.
Phoebe : Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
Phoebe : No, 'cause he's yummy.
Phoebe : Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.
Phoebe : Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?' [Scene: Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.Joey is there.]
Phoebe : I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Phoebe : Um-um, um-um.
Phoebe : Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
Phoebe : What?
Phoebe : Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
Phoebe : Paul.
Phoebe : Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Phoebe : I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
Phoebe : Yeah.
Phoebe : Is anyone else starting to really like him? [Scene: Hallway outside Chandler and Joey's apartment. Eddie walks up.] [Eddie tries his key and it won't work. He knocks and Chandler answers the door. He's got the door chained.]
Phoebe : Uh, see I think the one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on "Who's The Boss?"
Phoebe : [singing] Hold me close, young Tony Danza... [Ross and Rachel stare dumbfounded at Phoebe. Then, Monica walks from her bedroom to the bathroom, looking depressed and miserable.]
Phoebe : Oh my god, has she slept at all?
Phoebe : Oh, okay, that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning. And all I could hear was like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought, "Oh. Okay. So it's like a mouse or a possum." Then I realized, like, okay, where would a mouse or a possum get the money to make the phone call? [Scene: Joey and Chandler's apartment. Joey is walking toward the kitchen counter where Chandler is standing drinking a cup of coffee.]
Phoebe : Eww! It looks like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. [Ross gets up to throw out the cereal which is now contaminated by drain hair.]
Phoebe : Maybe cause you told him not to.
Phoebe : Oh yeah, Princess Leia and the gold bikini. Every guy our age loved that.
Phoebe : Mmm hmm. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment when she stopped being a princess and she became like, you know, a woman.
Phoebe : Oh yeah... [shivers] ohhh!
Phoebe : No. It's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. [Ross enters pulling a feeble, drab Monica.]
Phoebe : Rach! Look! [Phoebe takes two cinnamon buns and puts one over each ear while Rachel is signaling her not to do it] Ooh. Hi. Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me? [laughs gaily] There he is. [Ross stands there looking upset] [Scene: Joey and Chandler's apartment. Joey is watching Wheel Of Fortune sitting in the recliner. Chandler is just walking in. The player on TV is working on a puzzle with the letters -OUN- RUSH-ORE. The M and the T are missing.]
Phoebe : Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close your eyes. And think of a happy place. Tell me your happy place.
Phoebe : No. No. Not a Richard thing. Just put down the glass, and get out.
Phoebe : Well, okay, fine. Use my happy place, okay. I'm just gonna have to ask that you don't move anything.
Phoebe : Alright. So, you're in a meadow. Millions of stars in the sky.
Phoebe : Okay, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just the warm breeze and the moonlight flowing through the tree.
Phoebe : Betting and wagering of any kind are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just the lovely waterfalls, and the trickling fountains, and the calming sounds of the babbling brook...
Phoebe : Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Phoebe : Hello.
Phoebe : Thank you. I know, though.
Phoebe : Ooh, well you're my lucky penny. [Chandler walks out from the bathroom holding an issue of Cosmopolitan.]
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : Alright, already.
Phoebe : We could not, would not, want to wait.
Phoebe : I don't know. You might be the first one.
Phoebe : Oh my god!!! You...rotten boys!!! Chandler &
Phoebe : What am I gonna do?
Phoebe : Monica! Monica! You know, what gets out hummus?
Phoebe : Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
Phoebe : Oh, this. I got the hummus.
Phoebe : It won't go with this dress though.
Phoebe : How could it not be breezy? You know, cause you're in such a breezy place.
Phoebe : Monica, you don't know that.
Phoebe : [coming in with a sundress draped over her regular dress] Oh, Rach. Good, listen, isn't this perfect for me?
Phoebe : Oh, of course not for tonight.
Phoebe : Okay, I'm ready. [Phoebe comes out, but covering the hummus stain is a giant Christmas decoration with red ribbons, and garland, and all that. It's pretty large. The guys both start gasping and gapping when they see it.]
Phoebe : Rachel didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, "alright, fine, I'll be political."
Phoebe : Duh. Christmas.
Phoebe : Okay. The black. Oh, but do you have black with little strappies?
Phoebe : I'll get it. Okay. [picks up phone] Hi. Monica and Rachel's. [pause] Yeah. Just a second. Can I ask who's calling? [pause] Oh. [places hand over mouthpiece] Ooh. It's Michelle. Ooh. She must have that Caller ID thing? You should get that.
Phoebe : Okay, we're on it. We're on it. [Phoebe and Chandler jump up and run into Monica's bedroom. Door closes. Rachel comes out of her bedroom. She's wearing a pair of pants and a sweatshirt, obviously not dressed to go out. She also has a box with her. She walks over to the kitchen table and sits down.]
Phoebe : [yelling from back bedroom] Get away from that phone! [screams] [Phoebe walks out into the living room, holding phone and cord.]
Phoebe : [in calm voice] She's just getting dressed.
Phoebe : Eww. Let me get you another glass. This one's been sitting out.
Phoebe : Ross went to get a cab, so we could all...what are you doing? No, Monica, no! [Monica is at the phone in the living room, dialing.] Richard (on machine): Hi, this is Richard. [Monica keys in the access code.]
Phoebe : How did you do that?
Phoebe : I think after this, he'll be doing that himself. [they both leave]
Phoebe : Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
Phoebe : Hey!
Phoebe : Yeah, I can't say croissant. (realises) Oh my God!
Phoebe : Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
Phoebe : (sees a little kid playing with a race car bed) (to kid) Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. (the kid just stares at her, and she makes the 'that went right over your head' motion) Woo!
Phoebe : Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... (hops onto the bed) Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends. [Classroom. Joey is writing his name on the board, but turns around before he's done which causes him to write his name with a downward curve, and he then underlines it, and draws the line right through his name.]
Phoebe : Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Phoebe : Ooooh, nice.
Phoebe : Oh, yay!
Phoebe : Oh. (goes and answers the door and there is this huge black delievery guy.)
Phoebe : Okay.
Phoebe : Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there. (points to Monica's room)
Phoebe : Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
Phoebe : Is that a problem?
Phoebe : Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on. (they start shadow boxing)
Phoebe : Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
Phoebe : Oh! Oh! Oh!
Phoebe : Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.
Phoebe : 'Kay, put your head back.
Phoebe : All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Phoebe : Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
Phoebe : I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Phoebe : I am soo dead. (goes to Monica's room)
Phoebe : Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
Phoebe : I know, you must've won like a contest or something! (Phoebe starts to make a sound like a car accelerating)
Phoebe : I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
Phoebe : When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
Phoebe : It's Monica's bed. What?
Phoebe : So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Phoebe : Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay. [Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is greeting her Father for their brunch.]
Phoebe : Hey!
Phoebe : Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
Phoebe : Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
Phoebe : The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
Phoebe : Now what is Fabutec?
Phoebe : Waxine!!
Phoebe : Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
Phoebe : God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
Phoebe : They have the best stuff in there. [Chandler and Joey's, Ross has told Chandler and Joey his terrible act.]
Phoebe : (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
Phoebe : Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Phoebe : Was it not pain-free?
Phoebe : Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Phoebe : (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Phoebe : Oh!!
Phoebe : Ow!!! Monica and
Phoebe : Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow! (Hearing the screaming Chandler and Joey rush in. Joey has a pan, Chandler has a tea kettle.)
Phoebe : We're all right.
Phoebe : We're all right.
Phoebe : For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
Phoebe : Oh yeah, come here. (Puts a little wax on Joey's arm and puts a strip on it.)
Phoebe : Uh-huh.
Phoebe : (to Joey) What, what are they talking about?
Phoebe : Whe-where did he put it?! [Cut to Living Room]
Phoebe : Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Phoebe : Should we do something?
Phoebe : Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehack, 'cause it's like 9:15 now, and I'm not there. [Cut to Living Room]
Phoebe : We could eat the wax! It's organic.
Phoebe : No, not the used wax.
Phoebe : They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Phoebe : Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved. [Cut to Living Room]
Phoebe : They've been quiet for a long time.
Phoebe : (In a British accent) This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Phoebe : No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! ? Could you just give me the number for where they are?
Phoebe : Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Phoebe : Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass. [Scene: Rehearsal dinner hall. Ross and Emily are standing in the reception area. Monica arrives with her parents.]
Phoebe : (Looking relieved. She puts down the phone.) Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Phoebe : (Trying to get up.) Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! (Not able to get up.) God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?! [Scene: The Rehearsal Dinner Hall. Chandler, Joey, Ross, Emily, Monica, and all the bridal party are seated at the table. Chandler gets up to make a toast.]
Phoebe : Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica. Mrs.
Phoebe : Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm one of Ross's best friends. Mrs.
Phoebe : Yeah, um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies. Mrs.
Phoebe : No..umm, could I talk to one of them? It's very very important. Mrs.
Phoebe : Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
Phoebe : (Angrily.) Hey, were the hell have you been?!
Phoebe : I don't want to hear about her!!
Phoebe : No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
Phoebe : No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
Phoebe : I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She's going to ruin the wedding!!
Phoebe : All right, so, okay...
Phoebe : Okay, so I'm done my part, okay. It's your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?
Phoebe : So tell me about this girl? (The guys hotel room. Joey's there. Chandler comes out of the bathroom in a robe.)
Phoebe : Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It's Phoebe again. Mrs.
Phoebe : Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise. Mrs.
Phoebe : Did you stop Rachel?
Phoebe : So nothing got ruined?
Phoebe : Oh that's so great! Ohh, so what's going on now?
Phoebe : No!! wait, wait, wait!! Oh please, hold it up so I can listen. (Joey looks at Ross and holds the phone above Ross's shoulder.) (Chandler escorts Monica down the aisle.)
Phoebe : Hey!
Phoebe : Hey!
Phoebe : Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
Phoebe : Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
Phoebe : Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
Phoebe : Hey!
Phoebe : Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
Phoebe : You're not making the pies yourself?
Phoebe : Hey Rach.
Phoebe : What's Emma doing today?
Phoebe : Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
Phoebe : Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
Phoebe : (sarcastic) Oh... okay.
Phoebe : Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
Phoebe : Well, I was thinking...
Phoebe : Yeah! [Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Chandler is watching TV and Monica is cooking]
Phoebe : Hey.
Phoebe : We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
Phoebe : Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
Phoebe : (panicking) But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
Phoebe : Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
Phoebe : Yeah!
Phoebe : Yeah!
Phoebe : Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
Phoebe : Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
Phoebe : Why not!
Phoebe : Oh!
Phoebe : No, we're late!
Phoebe : Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
Phoebe : Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
Phoebe : And it looks like she put makeup on her!
Phoebe : You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
Phoebe : Alright, what are we gonna say?
Phoebe : Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
Phoebe : We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! (Others start to agree but she continues) OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
Phoebe : Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
Phoebe : Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his "fire" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out).
Phoebe : It's locked.
Phoebe : What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Phoebe : Oh yeah! [cut to Monica and Chandler]
Phoebe : Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
Phoebe : So bad.
Phoebe : Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica). (Monica takes it and reads the label)
Phoebe : Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
Phoebe : I'll pull you through.
Phoebe : I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
Phoebe : Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here. (Rachel, Ross and Phoebe have their hands full and are stuffing all kinds of things down Joeys pants.)
Phoebe : I know. Have you considered pageanting?

Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you? Phoebe: Why? Who?d you seen him with? Ross: No one, I?m just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck) Phoebe: TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW! Ross: (yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike?s a great guy, it was hypothetical! Phoebe: All right. (she releases him).

Chandler: (angrily) Look, if you did... Ross: Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want. Chandler: Totally. I had sex in High school... Ross: Me too. I'm good at it. Chandler: All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg. Ross: You got it. Chandler: All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with. Ross: Those are the pacts! Chandler: Oh, and Sheena Easton.

[We get back to the Class of '91 reunion, where Ross and Chandler are still looking at Missy.] Chandler: Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact. Ross: Thank you. (they shake hands) All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college? Chandler: Your hands are shaking. Ross: I know, and I can't stop sweating.

Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my... Gene: Diary. Joey: Noo, (whispering) more like a notebook... Damn it! (next word appears: "blueprint") Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either? Woha... hey...

(she drinks her tea) Hmmmm... raunchy! Rachel: Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party. Phoebe: Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life?

I had sex in High school... Ross: Me too. I'm good at it. Chandler: All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg. Ross: You got it.

Chandler: (angrily) Look, if you did... Ross: Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want. Chandler: Totally. I had sex in High school... Ross: Me too. I'm good at it. Chandler: All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg. Ross: You got it. Chandler: All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with. Ross: Those are the pacts! Chandler: Oh, and Sheena Easton.

Monica: I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time! Phoebe: If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex? Monica: (with no hesitation) Sex! Chandler: (looking at her) Seriously, answer faster! Monica: Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"! Chandler: (to Phoebe) It's like a giant hug. Phoebe: Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food? Ross: Food. Phoebe: Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs? Ross: Oh my God.

(he's on the street, talking to a woman) Rachel: Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty. Phoebe: OH! He's having an affair. Rachel: He's not having an affair! Phoebe: You know, I'm always right about these things. Rachel: No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you! Phoebe: Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it! (looking outside) See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her! Rachel: Oh, that doesn't mean anything. Phoebe: Oh yeah? Well, let's see. (she takes her mobile phone) Ok, duck down. (they both get down to hide themselves. Phoebe calls Chandler) Chandler: (picking up the phone) Hello. Phoebe: Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so...(back to Central Perk) ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel. Chandler: Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day. Phoebe: (shocked) Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember". Chandler: Those are all really old! Phoebe: Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm... Rachel: (whispering) "Dude, Where's My Car?" Phoebe: (glancing at her) What? Rachel: They're in a caaar... Phoebe: (to Chandler at the phone) Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye. Rachel: Geez! Phoebe: Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.

You smell like perfume and cigarettes. Chandler: I was in the car with Nancy all day. Monica: Nancy doesn?t smoke! Chandler: Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that! Monica: So? What do you think of the house? Chandler: It?s perfect. It?s everything we?ve been looking for. Monica: Isn?t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? Chandler: And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps? (pause) What were the things you said? Monica: Don?t you love the huge yard? Chandler: And the fireplace in the bedroom. Monica: And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents! Chandler: This is bringing out a lovely color in you! Monica: So? Do you think we should get it? Chandler: I don?t know. What do you think? Monica: I think we should. Chandler: I do too. Monica: This is huge! Chandler: I know. Monica: How bad you wanna smoke, right now. Chandler: I don?t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy?s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day. Monica: Gotcha. When do we tell them about this? Chandler: We don?t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing. Monica: Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard. Chandler: I know. Gooooood luck with it. [Scene: Joey?s apartment.

Well, something is not right. I just can?t believe he would do this to Monica! Ross: I know, and with the baby coming? Phoebe: So, should we tell her? Ross: I don?t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you? Phoebe: Why? Who?d you seen him with? Ross: No one, I?m just saying if... (Phoebe starts pinching him in his neck) Phoebe: TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW! Ross: (yelling in pain) I know nothing! Mike?s a great guy, it was hypothetical! Phoebe: All right. (she releases him). He is a good guy. You?re right, he wouldn?t cheat. Ross: Believe me, if I did see with someone, there?s no way I... (Phoebe starts pinching him again)

Chandler: (angrily) Look, if you did... Ross: Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want. Chandler: Totally. I had sex in High school... Ross: Me too. I'm good at it. Chandler: All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg. Ross: You got it. Chandler: All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with. Ross: Those are the pacts! Chandler: Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway. Ross: Oh, oh... maybe not you! [We get back to the Class of '91 reunion, where Ross and Chandler are still looking at Missy.] Chandler: Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact. Ross: Thank you.

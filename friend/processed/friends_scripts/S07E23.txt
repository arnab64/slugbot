 Commercial Break
 [Scene :  The Hallway, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel are discussing the note.]
 Phoebe :  Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
 Rachel :  Yeah but, maybe it?s not what we think. Maybe it?s tell Monica I?m sorry I?drank the last of the milk.
 Phoebe :  Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he?s changed his name, y?know? Tell Monica I?m sorry.
 Ross :  I think it means he freaked out and left!
 Phoebe :  Don?t be so negative! Good God! Isn?t it possible that Sorry is sitting in there (Joey and Rachel?s apartment) right now?!
 Rachel :  Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
 Ross :  Look?Okay, I?m just gonna?I?m gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
 Rachel :  Okay.

 Ross :  Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I?m looking for him?
 Mr. Geller :  And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I?m looking for her.
 (Ross points at him and exits.)
 [Scene :  The Movie Set, Richard and Joey are doing a scene.]

 Rachel :  (closing the door) Ross said there?s still no word from Chandler.
 Phoebe :  Oh man.
 Rachel :  Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
 Phoebe :  Okay. Well there?s one down.
 Monica :  (entering from her room, excitedly) I?m getting married today!!! (She trips and falls.) (Getting up) I think I just cracked a rib. But I don?t care because today?s my wedding day! My day is finally here!! (Runs back into her room.)
 Phoebe :  Y?know she might not even notice he?s gone.
 Monica :  (re-entering) I?m gonna start getting ready! (Goes back into her room.)
 Rachel :  God! Don?t?We can?t let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she?ll be in the gown and then he won?t show up and then she?s gonna have to take off the gown?
 Phoebe :  Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can?t do this here! (She drags her into the bathroom.)
 Rachel :  I?m sorry. I?m sorry. It?s just?It?s just so sad!
 Phoebe :  Yeah, but you?ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can?t see you like this! Then she?ll know something?s wrong!
 Rachel :  I know. I know. Oh God. (Looking around) There?s no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
 Phoebe :  Yeah. (Looks.) Oh, that?s gone too. This is Monica?s bathroom right?!
 Rachel :  Oh!
 Phoebe :  No-no! I-I?I found one.
 Rachel :  Okay.
 (Phoebe reaches into the trash can, pulls one out, and hands it to Rachel.)
 Rachel :  Oh thank you! (Wiping her nose.) Oh God! (She throws it out.) Can I have another one?
 Phoebe :  (looking into the trash can) Sure. (Reaching into the trash can.) Do you need some floss? (Grabs a piece of it.)
 Rachel :  Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn?t show up!
 Phoebe :  Oh here?s a whole bunch.
 Rachel :  Oh, I mean she?s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y?know? Then she?ll have to come back here and live all alone.
 Phoebe :  (finding something interesting in the trash can) Oh my God!
 Rachel :  What?
 Phoebe :  There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it?s positive. Monica?s pregnant. (Rachel covers her mouth.) So I guess she won?t be totally alone.

Chandler  :  And twenty-five it is.  Joey  :  You gave him cookies?  Monica  :  Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.

Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .  Rachel  :  Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?  Ross  :  How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? [Rachel walks off] Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?  Gunther  :  Yeah.  Ross  :  Here, go nuts. [gives him the Slinky and goes and sits with others at the couches]  Ross  :  Hey guys.  Chandler, Monica, and Joey  :  Hey.  Chandler  :  What's in the bag?  Ross  :  Um, just some presents.  Joey  :  C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.  Ross  :  [childishly] OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.  Monica  :  Cute.  Ross  :  I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.  [Ross holds up the blouse.

I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.  [Phoebe enters.] Phoebe  :  Hey.  Gang  :  Hey. Hi Phoebe.  Phoebe  :  Happy Christmas Eve Eve. [sees Ross's picture frame] Oh my God, where did you get this?  Ross  :  Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.  Phoebe  :  This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.  Chandler  :  Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.  Phoebe  :  No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.  Rachel  :  Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.  Phoebe  :  No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.  Rachel  :  How have you never been on Oprah?  Phoebe  :  [showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.  Monica  :  Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.  Phoebe  :  It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]  Monica  :  Oh, wait a minute honey.  Gang  :  Phoebs. [Phoebe leaves]  Monica  :  Wow.  Joey  :  So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .  Gang  :  Joey!  Joey  :  Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!  [Scene :  Phoebe's grandmother's place. Phoebe's grandmother is sitting at the table, reading the obituaries, and crossing out names in the phonebook.]  Grandmother  :  Esther Livingston. [scratches out name] Gone. [Phoebe enters.]  Grandmother  :  Hi, Phoe.  Phoebe  :  Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?  Grandmother  :  Oh, just updating the phonebook.  Phoebe  :  Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?  Grandmother  :  [nervously] Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?  Phoebe  :  Just, you know, to see... um.  Grandmother  :  Oh, sure, yeah. [gets a box with the pictures] This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.  Phoebe  :  OK, is this really my father?  Grandmother  :  Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.  Phoebe  :  OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.  Grandmother  :  Look, I. . .  Phoebe  :  Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.  Grandmother  :  Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.  Phoebe  :  Oh God.  Grandmother  :  It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.  Phoebe  :  Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?  Grandmother  :  Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.  Phoebe  :  OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?  Grandmother  :  Honey.  Phoebe  :  [realizes] Oh.  Grandmother  :  Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. [pulls apart a frame and pulls a picture out] This is the real him.  Phoebe  :  Oh.  [Scene :  Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel, Chandler, and Joey are decorating the Christmas tree.]  Chandler  :  Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.  Rachel  :  Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.  Chandler  :  Who said anything about Christmas?  [Monica and Ross enter.]  Monica  :  Hi.  Ross  :  Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?  Rachel  :  No, nothin'.  Monica  :  I hope she's OK.  Joey  :  Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.  Monica  :  How do you know exactly what she's going through?  Joey  :  She told us.  Chandler  :  So whaddya got there Monica?  Monica  :  Just some stuff for the party.  Ross  :  Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?  Monica  :  You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?  Chandler  :  Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?  Rachel  :  Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. [hands her a smashed box]  Monica  :  Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.  Joey  :  Monica, pigeons learn faster that you. [Ross approaches Rachel, away from everyone else.]  Ross  :  Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.  Rachel  :  Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .  Ross  :  C'mon Rachel.  Rachel  :  OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.  Ross  :  See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.   Rachel  :  Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. [she walks off and Ross puts his hand to his hair]  [Scene :  Back at Phoebe's. She is on the phone]  Phoebe  :  Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information. [hangs up]  [Phoebe's grandmother enters]  Grandmother  :  Hey.  Phoebe  :  Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.  Grandmother  :  C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?  Phoebe  :  Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.  Grandmother  :  Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.  Phoebe  :  No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.  Grandmother  :  I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.  Phoebe  :  Whattaya mean?  Grandmother  :  He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.  Phoebe  :  Wow. Thank you.  Grandmother  :  Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.  Phoebe  :  Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa!

Chandler  :  Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.  Joey  :  Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.  Chandler  :  Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.  [Phoebe drives up in the cab]  Joey  :  Hey, here she comes.  Chandler  :  Hey.  Joey  :  Hey.  [Phoebe runs over the curb. Joey gets in the back seat, Chandler in the front]  Phoebe  :  Hey.  Joey  :  Hey.  Phoebe  :  Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.  Chandler  :  Eeeshk.  Joey  :  Yeah, big stuff.  Phoebe  :  OK, let's go.  Chandler  :  OK.  Phoebe  :  Alright, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]  Chandler  :  OK. [reads paper] Brake left, gas right?  Phoebe  :  Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.  Chandler  :  [grabs for seat belt] Where's my seat belt?  Phoebe  :  Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.

Ross  :  Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .  Monica  :  Ross, the heat!  Ross  :  Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. [goes to the radiator and starts turning the knob] OK, this way is on, so this is. . . [breaks off the knob] off.  Rachel  :  Did you just break the radiator?  Ross  :  No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.  Monica  :  Well put it back.  Ross  :  It uhh, it won't go back.  Rachel  :  I'll call the super.  Monica  :  Here, let me try.  Ross  :  Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.  Monica  :  Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.  Rachel  :  [on phone] Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6?

You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.  Ross  :  [sitting at table talking to a girl] It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?  Monica  :  [carrying an ice cube tray] Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.  Ross  :  Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.  Monica  :  Really?

Ross  :  You mean hardball?  Monica  :  Whatever.  Rachel  :  What'cha gonna' do?  Ross  :  Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?  Mr. Treeger  :  No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.  Monica  :  So, wait, you really did like my cookies?  Mr. Treeger  :  Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.  Rachel  :  Nice seizing. . . gel boy.

Phoebe  :  Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.  Chandler  :  Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone.

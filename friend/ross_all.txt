Ross : (MORTIFIED) Hi.
Ross : I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
Ross : No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
Ross : No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
Ross : No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
Ross : I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again! (ENTER Rachel IN A WET WEDDING DRESS. SHE STARTS TO SEARCH AROUND THE ROOM)
Ross : Hi. (THEY GO TO HUG BUT Ross' UMBRELLA OPENS. HE SITS, DEFEATED AGAIN) (A MOMENT OF SILENCE AS Rachel SITS; THE OTHERS EXPECT HER TO EXPLAIN)
Ross : You can see where he'd have trouble.
Ross : Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Ross : He finally asked you out?
Ross : (CHOKED VOICE) That'd be good...
Ross : (NORMAL VOICE) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy! (A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Monica GETS IT; IT'S PAUL)
Ross : So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Ross : Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (THINKS) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put togethe r my new furniture.
Ross : Okay, sure.
Ross : (SQUATTING and READING INSTRUCTIONS) I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little whim guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs. (Chandler and Joey HAVE APPARENTLY FINISHED A BOOKCASE, BUT THERE IS A BIT LEFT OVER)
Ross : (CLUTCHING A BEER CAN and SNIFFING) This was Carol's favourite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
Ross : You guys.
Ross : You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
Ross : I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
Ross : (SCORNFUL) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonn a ask? (GAZES OUT OF THE WINDOW) (CUT TO Rachel STARING OUT OF HER WINDOW) SCENE 4: Monica + Rachel'S APARTMENT. Rachel IS MAKING COFFEE FOR Joey and Chandler)
Ross : I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Ross : You got a job?
Ross : The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Ross : C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Ross : No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : Mmm. (THEY Both REACH FOR THE LAST COOKIE) Oh, no-
Ross : No no no, go-
Ross : Split it?
Ross : Okay. (THEY SPLIT IT) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
Ross : You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
Ross : Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Ross : Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Ross : Goodnight. (Exit Rachel to her bedroom. Enter Monica in dressing gown, as Ross is leaving)
Ross : I just grabbed a spoon. (EXIT Ross) (CLOSING CREDITS) CREDITS SCENE: Central Perk
Ross : Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
Ross : Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
Ross : I cannot sleep in a public place.
Ross : It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
Ross : Why?
Ross : Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
Ross : So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
Ross : Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
Ross : Ohhh.
Ross : Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. (Joey IS PUZZLED) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
Ross : What are you doing?
Ross : Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
Ross : You can totally, totally live on this.
Ross : Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
Ross : Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (OFF Chandler'S LOOK) Sorry. Sorry. (THEY WALK ON. Chandler and Joey START TO TALK BUT Ross STOPS and WHINES)
Ross : Peach pit.
Ross : (POINTS) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
Ross : Actually, nectarines, but basically..
Ross : Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- (LOOKS UP, REALISES, and POINTS) -the bus stop... I'm fine.
Ross : (SQUEEZING PAST PEOPLE) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
Ross : No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
Ross : Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
Ross : Pass it! Pass it!
Ross : (JUMPS TO HIS FEET) Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
Ross : Hey, this- (SHE GIVES HIM A LOOK and THE GUYS BACK OFF) Heyy... (CUT TO THE GIRLS)
Ross : I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
Ross : Look, it's just a little more complicated...
Ross : Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
Ross : My first time with Carol was.. (MUMBLES)
Ross : It was my first time.
Ross : Hi. (HE IS WEARING A PIECE OF STEEL BandAGED TO HIS NOSE. HE TOSSES SOME FORMS ONTO THE RECEPTION DESK)
Ross : Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
Ross : The kid..? (TO KID) Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
Ross : (TO KID) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever- (TO Chandler) -can't do it. (TO KID) Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
Ross : 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
Ross : (TRIES TO SNATCH IT-) GIVE ME MY PUCK!! (-BUT IT FLIES OUT OF HIS GRASP and KNOCKS OUT THE RECEPTIONIST)
Ross : ...Now that was fun. CREDITS SCENE: Rachel+Monica'S PLACE (Joey and THE GIRLS ARE PLAYING TWISTER)
Ross : (DOING THE SPINNING) Okay,
Ross : Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe HAS TO BEND OVER.)Good. (Joey STARES AT HER BUTT APPRECIATIVELY) (PHONE RINGS, Chandler ANSWERS)
Ross : Green. To the green.
Ross : Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Ross : Multiple orgasms! Opening Credits Scene: Central Perk. [ All are there.]
Ross : Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Ross : Tony?
Ross : Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. [Rachel gives him a dirty look] Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Ross : That guy, he burns me up.
Ross : So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Ross : Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Ross : Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Ross : Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Ross : [on phone] Ok, bye. [hangs up] Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Ross : It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
Ross : Nuh-uh.
Ross : So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Ross : [sheepish] No.
Ross : Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
Ross : What's goin' on?
Ross : Was your basket on top?
Ross : So?
Ross : No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. [to woman] That's my friend's machine.
Ross : Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. [The woman and Ross stare at each other. Finally she takes her stuff out of the machine and leaves.]
Ross : [to the crowd in the laundromat] All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. [to Rachel] Ok, let's do laundry.
Ross : Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent. [Ross pulls out a huge box of laundry detergent.]
Ross : Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough. [Rachel starts to load her clothes.]
Ross : Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Ross : Rach, have you never done this before?
Ross : Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Ross : [visibly nervous] Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call. Scene: Fancy restaurant. [ Monica, Joey, Angela, and Bob are seated at the table.]
Ross : That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? [the buzzer on the washer goes off] I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...[opens up the washer] Uh-oh.
Ross : [not wanting to tell her] Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. [singing] Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Ross : Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Ross : All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Ross : Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Ross : You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
Ross : You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Ross : Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? [Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.] I'm fine, I'm fine.
Ross : No. Scene: Central Perk [ Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there. Ross has an icepack to his head.]
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Ross : Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen. (LIGHTS GO UP ON THE STAGE: Joey (AS FREUD) TALKING TO A FEMALE PATIENT)
Ross : Is it? Feels like two.
Ross : What?
Ross : Oh. Hel-lo!
Ross : He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Ross : C'mon! C'mon!
Ross : No, of course not! (THINKS) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Ross : Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking- (THEY All PRETEND TO FAll ASLEEP)
Ross : Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Ross : Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey- (THEY All FAll ASLEEP AGAIN) SCENE 3: Monica and Rachel'S (Rachel IS THERE; ENTER All BUT Joey)
Ross : Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Ross : Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
Ross : Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
Ross : Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
Ross : Monica? You're Mom. (Monica GASPS)
Ross : C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
Ross : You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening? (AD BREAK) SCENE 4: Monica and Rachel'S (MORNING) (Monica IS GETTING THE DOOR)
Ross : Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again? (ENTER Joey)
Ross : No? What happened, big guy?
Ross : It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
Ross : Yeah, I mean- I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it- feel like your shot..?
Ross : She is a kook. (CLOSING CREDITS) CREDITS SCENE: Monica IN BED (SHE IS WIDE AWAKE)
Ross : And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Ross : That's my sister.
Ross : Phoebs, what about you?
Ross : Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
Ross : The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Ross : Step back.
Ross : Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Ross : Come on.
Ross : [sarcastically] And you didn't marry him because...?
Ross : Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Ross : It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
Ross : But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Ross : Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Ross : Mmmm.
Ross : I do.
Ross : [innocently] What?
Ross : [acts surprised] What? [pause] Why not?
Ross : No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Ross : I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Ross : I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. [Joey looks at him] What? What, now?
Ross : Shhhh!
Ross : We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. [everyone is silent] Don't you hear that?
Ross : See?
Ross : [to Joey] OK, here goes.
Ross : I'm going to do it.
Ross : You come out there, you're a dead man.
Ross : Thanks. [Joey hugs him] OK.
Ross : OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Ross : OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Ross : Yes, yes, that's right...
Ross : What? [the cat jumps on his shoulders] Ow! [ Scene: Inside. Monica, Joey and Phoebe are singing while outside, Ross and Rachel are trying to get the cat off of Ross' shoulder.]
Ross : Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Ross : [nonchalantly] Yeah? Scene: ATM vestibule.
Ross : [rolling] Lucky sixes....
Ross : [jealous] So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Ross : No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Ross : That, that is funny... [to Joey].... and Rachel keeps touching him. [Phoebe enters.]
Ross : [mocking Paolo] Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah.... [Rachel walks away from Paolo, laughing.]
Ross : Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Ross : That's... that's classic.
Ross : Paolo. Hi.
Ross : Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Ross : Thing, yes. Thing.
Ross : No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
Ross : No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Ross : Yeah! Se vice?
Ross : So you do know a little English.
Ross : Do you know the word crapweasel?
Ross : That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel! [They hug.] Scene: ATM vestibule [ Chandler and Jill are sitting below the counter with two pens dangling from their chains in front of them. Jill is showing Chandler how to swing the pen around his head.]
Ross : Thank you.
Ross : Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Ross : OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah... [The lights come back on, and Rachel and Paolo are making out. Ross clutches his chest.]
Ross : Oh.. oh... oh.
Ross : Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
Ross : No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so... [Joey congratulates Ross, sees Chandler's look and abruptly stops]
Ross : [To Joey] So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Ross : So, uh, how's she doing? Aunt Lillian: The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
Ross : Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Ross : Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants. Mr. Geller: Not just restaurants, from our house. [The nurse comes out of Nana's room] Nurse: Mrs. Geller? [Everyone stands up. Cut to Ross and Monica in Nana's room]
Ross : She looks so small.
Ross : Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
Ross : Bye, Nana. [He goes to kiss her but she moves. Monica screams. Ross shouts and stares in disbelief. Monica runs out of the room]
Ross : Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite.. Mrs. Geller: What?
Ross : She's not- past, she's present, she's back. Aunt Lillian: [Reentering] What's going on? Mr. Geller: She may have died. Aunt Lillian: She may have died? Mr. Geller: We're looking into it. [Monica returns with the nurse and they go into Nana's room]
Ross : I, uh, I'll go see. [He goes in] Nurse: This almost never happens! [Nana passes for the second time and the nurse pulls the blanket over her. Ross and Monica go to tell the family]
Ross : Now she's passed. [Scene 3: Central Perk. [ The other four are there]
Ross : Twice.
Ross : I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
Ross : Nono, she's gone.
Ross : I thought it was gonna be a closed casket. Mrs. Geller: Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice! [They open a cupboard which, amongst other things, contains a chest of drawers] Mrs. Geller: Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
Ross : [Sarcastic] I don't see why not. [He tries pushing against the chest of drawers. Then he opens one of the drawers and climbs into the closet using that; he falls behind the chest of drawers with a shout]
Ross : Here's my retainer! Scene 5: Mon+Rach's. [ Monica is talking to her father] Mr. Geller: I was just thinking. When my time comes-
Ross : [Holding a dress out from inside the closet] This one? Aunt Lillian: No.
Ross : I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy. Aunt Lillian: You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one. Mrs. Geller: You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Ross : Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. [Starts to climb over the furniture] Aunt Lillian: Wait! We need shoes! [Ross falls back inside]
Ross : Okay. Um, how about these? [Holds out a pair] Mrs. Geller: That's really a day shoe.
Ross : And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier? Aunt Lillian: Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Ross : [Forages around] Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work. Aunt Lillian: No, it really should be burgundy. Mrs. Geller: Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Ross : No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back. [He finds a shoebox (out of shot), pulls it down and opens it. It is full of Sweet 'n' Los.]
Ross : Oh my God.. Mrs. Geller: Is everything all right, dear?
Ross : Yeah, just... just Nana stuff. [He reaches up higher and knocks down another shoebox lid. Sweet 'n' Los rain down on him] [Commercial] Scene 7: Mon+Rach's. [ Mon+Rach are preparing to leave for the funeral]
Ross : [Entering] How we doing, you guys ready?
Ross : Some days it's all I can think about.
Ross : What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
Ross : Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
Ross : I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- [Not looking where he is going he falls into an open grave] All: God! Ross!
Ross : I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised... Scene 9: The wake, at the Gellers' house. [ Ross is lying on his back, with Phoebe squatting over him, checking to see if he's injured]

Ross : ...Chandler!
Ross : [Hugs him] And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me. Andrea: [Turns to a friend] You were right. [They walk off and leave Chandler.]
Ross : Rachel. Rachel Rachel. [Sits down beside her] I love you the most.
Ross : No.
Ross : Oh.. you don't get it! [Passes out and slumps across her] [Cut to Joey watching TV in the corner. He makes an extravagant gesture of disappointment] Mr. Geller: Whaddya got there?
Ross : That little naked guy would be me.
Ross : Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Ross : Got me.
Ross : Looks like a fun gang. [They all look at each other and smile]
Ross : [Looking] Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something. End credits. Scene: Chandler's office block, yet another coffee break. Enter Lowell...
Ross : No, they're not.
Ross : You're wrong.
Ross : You're wrong.
Ross : [getting up, upset] I'm calling Mom. [Joey enters. His face looks abnormally colorful.]
Ross : [to Monica] Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
Ross : Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Ross : Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Ross : [mimicking] Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner. [Scene: Carol and Susan's apartment. Susan is there. Ross enters.]
Ross : Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
Ross : Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but... SUSAN: Come in.
Ross : Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
Ross : Kinda like a big face without skin.
Ross : Ok. [browsing the apartment] Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
Ross : [picking up a book] Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
Ross : The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
Ross : You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
Ross : Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Ross : Really?
Ross : Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
Ross : Oh, I hate this story.
Ross : I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
Ross : That's closer. [Rachel enters, excited.]
Ross : Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. [Ross grabs for some food, Monica slaps his hand away.]
Ross : Ok, Mom never hit. [Ross exits.]
Ross : Ok, ok, here we go. [he crouches down near her stomach] Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Ross : Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
Ross : [quickly talking] Hello, baby. Hello, hello. [Scene: Monica's apartment. The group is coming back from the roof.]
Ross : And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Ross : Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok? [Susan enters.]
Ross : Shh! [singing] Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! [to Carol] Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Ross : Does it always, uh--?
Ross : Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
Ross : Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts. [Scene: Outside Monica's apartment. Joey has a tray full of keys, and is trying each one in the lock.]
Ross : Here we come, walkin' down the--this doesn't smell like Mom's.
Ross : I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Ross : And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Ross : Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. [A monkey jumps on to his shoulder.] All: Oooh!
Ross : 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
Ross : My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
Ross : Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
Ross : Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- [Realises] ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'. [Intro] [Scene 1: Central Perk. Phoebe is getting ready to sing. Joey is not there]
Ross : How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
Ross : Come here, Marcel. Sit here. [Marcel wanders off]
Ross : Just a smidge.
Ross : C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
Ross : Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Ross : I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Ross : Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Ross : So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
Ross : Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
Ross : Four.
Ross : Five. [Buries his head in his hands]
Ross : Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
Ross : Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
Ross : Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
Ross : Really.
Ross : What, uh... what juggling thing?
Ross : No.
Ross : Par-tay!
Ross : 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
Ross : Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
Ross : Thank you. [She walks off] C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? [Marcel runs off] Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later. [The door opens. Rachel is standing there. Her coat is muddy and torn, her hair is dishevelled and her face is bruised. Everyone turns to look]
Ross : [Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler] Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in. Janice: [Startles them] There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Ross : Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
Ross : [Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel] I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
Ross : C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Ross : Oh, please.. [Rachel opens the door to Paolo] Paolo: Bona sera.
Ross : When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Ross : Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Ross : [Entering] What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place. Mrs. Bing: Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug. [They both sit down] Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
Ross : Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy. [Enter Rachel and Paolo. They are both somewhat flustered]
Ross : ...But a man can change. [Downs a shot] [Time lapse. Ross is now clearly drunk. He is holding up a shot glass to his eye like a jeweller's eye]
Ross : Anyone want me to appraise anything? [Rachel feeds something to Paolo. He eats it and licks her hand]
Ross : Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. [A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and he tries to pretend he was in the other one] Mrs. Bing: What is with you tonight?
Ross : Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing. Mrs. Bing: [To phone] Okay, thank you. [To Ross] It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
Ross : No. It's the one he's licking. Mrs. Bing: She's supposed to be with you.
Ross : You're good. Mrs. Bing: Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
Ross : The girl on the cover with her nipples showing? Mrs. Bing: No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
Ross : When? Mrs. Bing: He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
Ross : The guy on the cover with his nipples showing? Mrs. Bing: No, it's you!
Ross : Please. Mrs. Bing: No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
Ross : Right. Mrs. Bing: You are gonna be fine, believe me. [She kisses him on the cheek]
Ross : Uh-oh... [...Then full on the mouth] [Enter Joey]
Ross : Hey, is Chandler here?
Ross : Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... [Joey shakes his head] Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Ross : Okay.
Ross : What code?
Ross : Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Ross : No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Ross : Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Ross : I don't know, God, I- well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's-
Ross : Well- not in the same way...
Ross : Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here... [Mon+Rach's door opens and Rachel and Paolo emerge]
Ross : Hey.
Ross : Well, not playing raquetball!
Ross : He didn't get the goggles!
Ross : Do they wait for me to do this? [Joey and Ross go into Monica and Rachel's apartment]
Ross : Why would I tell him?
Ross : Oh...
Ross : You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Ross : Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... [He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him] I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
Ross : I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Ross : Thanks, man, big help.
Ross : I wasn't- I mean, I-
Ross : I know-
Ross : Chandler-
Ross : Chandler-
Ross : Joey-
Ross : I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Ross : Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a-
Ross : Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Ross : Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Ross : [To the rest of Central Perk] We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Ross : No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
Ross : Okay, 'you' can't, or [Points to Chandler] you can't? [Chandler grabs his finger] Okay, that's my finger. [Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee] That's, that's my knee. [To Central Perk] Still doing the play. Aaah! [Cut to the hospital. Monica bursts in, closely followed by Phoebe. There is no sign of Coma Guy- his bed is empty]
Ross : Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Ross : You're kidding.
Ross : Wow!
Ross : 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say 'When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?'?
Ross : So, what's going on now?
Ross : Whaddya see?
Ross : [Very politely] Mrs. Bing. Mrs. Bing: Mr. Geller. [She leaves] [Ross knocks on Mon+Rach's door]
Ross : You mean that?
Ross : Yeah? How'd it go?
Ross : Well, howdya feel?
Ross : Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? [Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down] But.. we don't have to go down that road. [Credits] [Credits Scene: Mon+Rach's. Rachel is handing out copies of her book to the gang]
Ross : Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Ross : Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! [snaps fingers]
Ross : [waves] Hello! Joey [in baby-like voice] How come you don't live with Mommy? [pause; shows Ross less than amused] How come Mommy lives with that other lady? [pause; Ross still looks less than amused; Joey smiling] What's a lesbian? [playfully hits Ross] [Rachel enters with Paolo, speaking Italian. Ross looks annoyed]
Ross : Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...[makes flinging motions with hands] flung by now? [Camera pans back to Rachel]
Ross : ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? [pauses, looks suddenly inspired] I could call immigration! [Scene: Chandler and Joey leaving girls' apartment, carrying lasagna]
Ross : Hey, hello! mmwa! [kisses Carol] I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
Ross : Oh, that's great, that is great! [Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a picture frame]
Ross : Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
Ross : Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh oh oh!
Ross : No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! [pauses] Or isn't... [Susan enters]
Ross : Susan...
Ross : Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
Ross : Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be? Carol and
Ross : No problem, ok, mmmwa [kisses Carol] oh, mmmwa [kisses Carol's stomach, then punches Susan's shoulder] Susan... [Ross leaves.]
Ross : Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
Ross : Wait--oh--hey--huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
Ross : Hi Pheebs!
Ross : I'm familiar with his work, yes...
Ross : My God!
Ross : The actress! [all talking indistinctly, high-fiving]
Ross : Thanks Rach. [Rachel walks away]
Ross : You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? [waiting for guys to chime in]
Ross : I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
Ross : Come on, two on one.
Ross : What, now?
Ross : How's it going?
Ross : Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... [shuts door in his face and walks away]
Ross : Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
Ross : [pulls Monica back] ...and I really think it should be me. [Scene: balcony where Ross has climbed through the window]
Ross : Hey.
Ross : You all right?
Ross : Come here. [he hugs Rachel] Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
Ross : What?
Ross : Huh.
Ross : Ohhhh [hugs her & sighs] [Scene: inside girls' apartment]
Ross : See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Ross : Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Ross : I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Ross : Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! [babbling] Huh, am I having a boy?
Ross : I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy! [Joey & Chandler run in]
Ross : I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Ross : I'm having a son. Um... [Ross looks scared] END CREDITS [Scene: foosball table]
Ross : You what? Wh- what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Ross : Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your pee-pee.
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad. [Cut to Chandler, Ross and Roger sitting at the table. Ross is upset]
Ross : Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level that-that she was a lesbian? Roger: I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
Ross : Why? Why would I- why? Why? Why? Why? Roger: I don't know. Maybe- maybe low self-esteem, maybe- maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you-
Ross : That- that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
Ross : Nonono, that-that's not what I was saying...
Ross : Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good! [Cut to later. Rachel is in tears]
Ross : I dunno, there's just something about...
Ross : We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry. Phoebe :Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out? All: ...No, we hate him.
Ross : So Joey, you okay?
Ross : She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
Ross : She lent me an egg once.
Ross : Aw, right.
Ross : Hey. [stutters something incoherent]
Ross : An egg?
Ross : I think it's insane.
Ross : Hi. She said yes.
Ross : I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half. [Ross starts to laugh, and then makes a face like 'Why did I just say that?' Ross' ex-wife, Carol, and her lesbian lover, Susan, enter the restaurant. Ross stares at them.]
Ross : The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
Ross : If you wanna put a label on it.
Ross : Nope, nope, that's it. [Carol takes off her jacket, her pregnant belly is exposed.]
Ross : Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. [to Carol and Susan] Helloo! [Scene: Monica's apartment. The girls are holding their boyfriend bonfire.]
Ross : So, um, what do you do for a living?
Ross : Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
Ross : Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
Ross : Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...[struggling]...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major! [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Firemen are there to handle the bonfire that got out of control.] Fireman
Ross : You did so. I swear, I swear--[noticing Kristin's absence] How long has she been in the bathroom?
Ross : Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
Ross : Oh, god. [He puts his head down on the grill] You know, this is still pretty hot. [He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.]
Ross : No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you. [They kiss.]
Ross : No but, no but.
Ross : That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
Ross : What's going on?
Ross : Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech. [Monica enters, excited.]
Ross : Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Ross : OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Ross : Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Ross : Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I might introduce her to my monkey.
Ross : Well, I don't know.... [gestures] huh-huh.... but I'm hoping [gestures] huh-huh.
Ross : He's not going to hurt you! Keep going, Celia. Marcel...
Ross : Alright... [lifts Marcel away] [Scene: Monica's apartment. Everyone is there but Ross and Chandler. Monica is making food, and having everyone try it.]
Ross : OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
Ross : [embarrassed] Wha... what, here?
Ross : Ah....
Ross : [panicked] Er.... um.....
Ross : Um... uh.... vulva. Commercial [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Joey and Ross are there, discussing what happened last night.]
Ross : Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Ross : Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Ross : [deadpan] Please be kidding.
Ross : OK. [closes eyes] I'm in my apartment...
Ross : That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. [gets up, walks across room]
Ross : Joey, please.
Ross : [impressed] Wow.
Ross : I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : Sure.
Ross : OK, turn around. [Joey looks taken aback] I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Ross : Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Ross : I, er... [At this point, Chandler walks through the door. Ross and Joey both have their backs to him, so they don't notice. Chandler sees the situation and remains quiet, watching.]
Ross : I want to take my tongue... and... [Chandler is completely astounded.]
Ross : ....and....
Ross : ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with... [Chandler leans back against the wall and Ross and Joey hear him. Ross and Joey both notice at the same time. They slowly stop, and then very slowly turn around to see Chandler staring at them.]
Ross : [rushing to explain] Funny story!
Ross : Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
Ross : Oh, I was unbelievable.
Ross : I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were different characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Ross : Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so...
Ross : Yeah, which was nice.
Ross : I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, supposedly by accident.
Ross : And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did and pee-ed all over the crossword.
Ross : Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, but I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class.
Ross : No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
Ross : No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
Ross : I know.
Ross : I'm Ross Geller, and that's, that's my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this is Susan Bunch. Susan is Carol's... Who's next?
Ross : Susan is Carol's Carol's Carol's friend.
Ross : Like buddies.
Ross : You know how close women can get.
Ross : Although I was married to her.
Ross : Right.
Ross : A little.
Ross : Absolutely. So, twins. Huh, that's like two births. Ouch.
Ross : It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
Ross : Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote...
Ross : Relax, I'll fix it.
Ross : How did he do this?
Ross : You ok?
Ross : You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Ross : Sorry. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's Carol?
Ross : No, no, no. I think I should stay. I think we should both know what's going on.
Ross : What? What?
Ross : Ok, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
Ross : I see. So what do you propose to do?
Ross : Flip me for it? No, no, no--heads, heads!
Ross : Susan, go deep.
Ross : Carol, honey, shhh, everything's gonna be all right.
Ross : I'm gonna be a father.
Ross : I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realized the baby was having me.
Ross : Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
Ross : Come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt--
Ross : I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid. Chandler &
Ross : No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby. I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defense is comin' right at me.
Ross : Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, I just heave it downfield.
Ross : Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield, and I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father.
Ross : Whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Ross : Tonight.
Ross : You take your time.
Ross : What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Ross : Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon shmush.
Ross : Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
Ross : Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all? Mr.
Ross : Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing? Mr.
Ross : No, no, Dad, I was just wondering. Mr.
Ross : Thanks, Dad. Really, you know, I just, I just needed to know, when did you start to feel like a father? Mr.
Ross : No, we can go to Williamsburg. Mr.
Ross : Good. Maybe he can switch it back. Maybe not.
Ross : Hey.
Ross : Well did you try calling her?
Ross : Do you have a point?
Ross : It's just a furball.
Ross : Yours. I just got 43 points for "kidney".
Ross : I had a "k". Where's my "k"?
Ross : You've got to help me! My monkey swallowed a "k"!
Ross : No, you don't understand. The animal hospital is way across town. He's choking. I don't know what else to do.
Ross : Lady, he is people. He has a name, ok? He watches Jeopardy. He touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please, have a heart! Dr.
Ross : He looks so tiny.
Ross : Yeah. The doctor got the "k" out. He also found an "m" and an "o".
Ross : Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine. He's just sleeping now.
Ross : No, why?
Ross : Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.
Ross : Rach, did you proofread these?
Ross : Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent computer skills.
Ross : Hey.
Ross : I don't know.
Ross : No, it's not just that. It's just--I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... [begins to stare lovingly at Rachel]
Ross : What?
Ross : Who?
Ross : Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... [Rachel comes over, Ross lays head on table]: Hiiii!
Ross : We're fine, we're fine.
Ross : Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
Ross : Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'
Ross : No, women are welcome to play.
Ross : Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
Ross : No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't--you can't do--
Ross : No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that.
Ross : Oh, you're... [gives up] [Monica comes back to the table with plates of food.]
Ross : Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy...
Ross : The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Ross : Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
Ross : [pause]...Yeah.
Ross : Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... [claps hands three times]
Ross : I'm not a nice guy. [Scene: Ross' apartment. Chandler and Joey are there. Ross enters with a pizza.]
Ross : Alright boys, let's eat.
Ross : You still on that?
Ross : You are way off, pal.
Ross : Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time--not any more. I just--I-- [Marcel makes a screeching noise in background.]
Ross : Marcel! Where are you going with that disc? [Marcel puts a CD in the player.]
Ross : You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK--if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble. ['The Lion Sleeps Tonight' starts to play. Marcel starts to dance.] [Scene: Monica's apartment. Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe are there.]
Ross : Alright. [Ross shuts off the CD player. Marcel runs into the bedroom and slams the door.]
Ross : I'm gonna pay for that tonight. [Knock on door. Ross opens it. Rachel enters.]
Ross : Hey.
Ross : Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?
Ross : Alright.
Ross : So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.
Ross : Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...
Ross : So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.
Ross : Uh... to the bathroom.
Ross : I want to go to the bathroom. [exits]
Ross : Alright. [to Rachel]: Your money's mine, Green.
Ross : Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. [lays down cards]
Ross : Oh, I am very in.
Ross : No, not this time. [he folds] So... what'd you have?
Ross : Come on, show them to me. [reaches for her cards, Rachel covers them up]
Ross : Show them to me!
Ross : Let me see! Show them!
Ross : First of all, I'm not losing...
Ross : Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the--
Ross : [mimicking Rachel] Mee mee, mee-mee mee.
Ross : I'm in for fifty cents. [throws it in]
Ross : I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.
Ross : No, I fold. [lays cards down, and gets up]
Ross : I'm in. [throws in chips]
Ross : One. [Rachel gives him the card.]
Ross : I bet two dollars. [throws it in]
Ross : I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. [throws it in] [The other four look amazed at the large pot.]
Ross : [to Joey]: Joey, I'm a little shy.
Ross : Fifteen.
Ross : Thank you.
Ross : [to Rachel]: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got? [Long pause as they both look at each other.]
Ross : You got me. [Monica and Phoebe get up and start celebrating in the kitchen, pouring wine and singing. Rachel, shocked, goes to join them.]
Ross : Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know. [looks at Rachel] But, uh... look how happy she is. [smiles] [Chandler and Joey look at her, and then look back at him. They dive for Ross's hand to see what he had, and he tries to stop them from looking.] CLOSING CREDITS [Scene: All six are playing Pictionary at Monica's apartment. Monica is drawing a picture, and the three guys are guessing. She draws what looks like an airplane.]
Ross : Uh.... bean! Bean! [Rachel begins tapping the picture of the bean frantically.]
Ross : Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. [Marcel brings the rice] Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. [Rachel ignores him] 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
Ross : Hi.
Ross : Really.
Ross : Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
Ross : Waitwait. I, I got it. I was there.
Ross : Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could- could curl your toes, might just be the one who... [Enter the other four]
Ross : ...Gets interrupted. Hi!
Ross : Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
Ross : That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
Ross : 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there. [Scene 3: The guys at Joe-G's Pizza]
Ross : I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
Ross : Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
Ross : Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
Ross : Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
Ross : Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Ross : Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Ross : Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? [Uncorks the wine] Well-
Ross : Okay, quick and painful. [Starts to cork the wine]
Ross : Oh, what? Whatwhat?
Ross : ...Yeah?
Ross : [Angry] I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
Ross : No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
Ross : You called Animal Control?
Ross : Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
Ross : That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment! [A knock on the door. Rachel swiftly opens it]
Ross : Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
Ross : Cat!
Ross : My uncle Marcel.
Ross : Marcel?
Ross : Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
Ross : Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. [Kicks a sign in frustration] And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
Ross : Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
Ross : Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
Ross : I don't even wanna hear it, you're just-
Ross : Oh, forget it, okay?
Ross : What? What? [A man carrying a box of bananas walks past them. They stare for a minute and then hobble after him] Both: Hey! Hey, Bananaman! [Scene 4: Everyone in the hall outside Mr. Heckles' door. Ross is carrying the box of bananas. He bangs on the door]
Ross : Hi, did you order some bananas? Mr. Heckles: What about it?
Ross : Gimme back my monkey. Mr. Heckles: I don't have a monkey.
Ross : Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel? [Marcel jumps into view wearing a pink dress. Everybody gasps]
Ross : Marcel! What've you done to him? Mr. Heckles: That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Ross : Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. [Marcel starts to go to him] Mr. Heckles: C'mere, Patti. [Marcel turns round]
Ross : C'mere, Marcel. [Turns to Ross] Mr. Heckles: C'mere, Patti. [Turns to Mr. Heckles] Luisa: [Out of shot] Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! [Marcel runs to the door and into Luisa's cage, which she slams shut] Gotcha.
Ross : Okay, gimme my monkey back. Mr. Heckles: That's my monkey. Luisa: You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge. Mr. Heckles: That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
Ross : Alright, I want my monkey. Luisa: No!
Ross : [To Rachel]You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
Ross : It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. [Marcel resists] Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
Ross : Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I-
Ross : Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
Ross : Alright. [He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised] The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. [He sits down and starts to pour the wine] Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um- [Barry bursts in] Barry: Rachel.
Ross : We have got to start locking that door! [Credits] [Credits scene: the other four in Central Perk. They are looking through Monica's high school yearbook]
Ross : I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
Ross : I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
Ross : Okay, okay, what's going on?
Ross : Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
Ross : What? What? What?!
Ross : That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Ross : That's, that's nice twice!
Ross : What was with the dishes?
Ross : ...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Ross : You- you had what?
Ross : What, uh... what were you thinking?
Ross : No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
Ross : It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Ross : (GOING) I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay? (EXIT Ross. A PHONE RINGS. Chandler DIVES FOR HIS PHONE)
Ross : Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Ross : Thanks. (ENTER Joey)
Ross : "Heating device".
Ross : Five letters.
Ross : I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut? (Eenter Danielle)
Ross : Second date!
Ross : I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Ross : Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- [Marcel runs toward Rachel's room] come here, Marcel-
Ross : What? It's, it's just a phase.
Ross : Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Ross : What?
Ross : [Mortified] Hi. Chandler and
Ross : At the vet.
Ross : She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Ross : She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Ross : I'm gonna have to give him up. [Commercial] [Scene 5: Central Perk- time lapse. The guys are sitting like the Three Monkeys]
Ross : I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Ross : No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin', he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Ross : Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Ross : What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Ross : Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Ross : [Reading letters] Oh God. [To Marcel] We didn't get into Scranton. [To the others] That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
Ross : Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Ross : Where exactly is your zoo? Dr. Baldhara: Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Ross : Yes. Dr. Baldhara: Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
Ross : Nono, he's, he's very docile. Dr. Baldhara: Even if he were... cornered?
Ross : Well I, I don't know. Why? Dr. Baldhara: Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Ross : He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean... Dr. Baldhara: How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Ross : Why- why- why would he need a blade? Dr. Baldhara: Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel. [Chandler and Joey burst in, with Marcel] Chandler and
Ross : He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego! Dr. Baldhara: You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains. [Scene 9: Monica and Rachel's. Rachel is dusting. She comes to the table, lifts all the magazines and wipes under them, then just puts them down again. Monica bursts in, obviously drunk]
Ross : Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Ross : Just, just say what you feel.
Ross : That was good.
Ross : Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him. All: Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. [They just stand there, then realise what he means and go to the other end of the room]
Ross : Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. [He sits down and Marcel jumps down and sits beside him] Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- [Marcel climbs down and starts humping his leg] Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him. [Marcel is put in a cage and taken away. Closing credits] [Credits scene: A casting session somewhere] Actor: [Very melodramatically, and very badly] Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek... Casting Director #1: That's fine, thank you. Casting Director #2: Next. [Joey walks onstage]
Ross : Why, why, why would you dream that?
Ross : I love it, when we share. [Ross goes over to the counter. Chandler follows him.]
Ross : I can?t belive you two had sex in her dream.
Ross : Phoebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Ross : Oh, it?s my new beeper.
Ross : No, it?s for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Ross : College?
Ross : Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it?s baby time. Baby time.
Ross : [on phone] Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. [pause] No, Andre is not here. [to Joey] Third time today. [on phone] Yes, I?m sure... No, sir. I don?t perform those kind of services.
Ross : [on phone] Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that?s right. That?s right, JUMBO with a U, sir. [pause] No, belive me, you don?t want me. Judging by his number, I?d be a huge disappointment. [pause] All rightie, bye bye. [Phoebe and Chandler enters]
Ross : Oh, oh Chandler...
Ross : 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.' [Phoebe, Joey and Ross laughs]
Ross : 'My scones.' [Phoebe, Joey and Ross laughs again]
Ross : [on phone] Okay, Andre should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. [to Phoebe] Just easier that way.
Ross : Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
Ross : You?re sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
Ross : Huh!
Ross : Are you not seeing him anymore?
Ross : Oh, yeah.
Ross : Sorry.
Ross : It?s morphin time!
Ross : Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she?s having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Ross : Oh, welll this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know. [Ethan enters]
Ross : I thought that was just a rumour.
Ross : Are you?re hands still wet?
Ross : I?m here.
Ross : What? [his beeper goes off] Great, now I?m having a baby.
Ross : Ooh, Ooh.
Ross : I?m having... I?m having a baby. [jumps back onto the table again] I?m having a... Where?s the phone? The phone?
Ross : I?m hurt. CLOSING CREDITS [Scene: The hall between the apartments. Ross is eagerly waiting for the others to get ready, to go to the hospital.]
Ross : Monica, let?s go. Come on now people, woman in labor. [Chandler struts out from his apartment]
Ross : Yeah, save it for the cab, okay. [Rachel comes out from their apartment with a mirror and a lipstick in her hands]
Ross : What are you doing? We?re going to a hospital.
Ross : Joey, get out of the fridge.
Ross : What is that? [refering to the sandwich]
Ross : Save it.
Ross : Monica, come on now. Let?s go, baby coming. [Monica enters from their apartment, crying]
Ross : That?s nice. Get out Let?s go, come on.
Ross : She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
Ross : I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug. [Joey makes a sound of absolute disgust.]
Ross : God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.
Ross : She's not even here yet.
Ross : [to Carol] Where the hell have you been?
Ross : Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.
Ross : Stopped for a Chunky.
Ross : [weakly] No. [Carol's doctor, Dr. Franzblau arrives.] Dr.
Ross : Dr. Franzblau, hi. Dr.
Ross : 59 seconds. [holds up his watch] Quartz, ha.
Ross : I'll get it.
Ross : I got it--I'm getting it! [They both leave just as Rachel enters the room, holding a cup.]
Ross : Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
Ross : Breathe.
Ross : Breathe.
Ross : Breathe.
Ross : 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...
Ross : Who the hell is Jordie?
Ross : No no no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.
Ross : What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.
Ross : I got it.
Ross : I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.
Ross : Why?
Ross : No, you started it.
Ross : But--
Ross : [to Susan] Thanks a lot.
Ross : [to Carol] Yeah, listen--
Ross : Please. This is so your fault.
Ross : Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.
Ross : You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
Ross : Oh, I'm threatened by you?
Ross : Yeah, Susan.
Ross : I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. [walks backwards as if he is going to break down the door, but steps in a bucket and falls] Ow. [Scene: Carol's room. Rachel and Dr. Franzblau are there with her.]
Ross : Help! Help!
Ross : Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. [to Susan] This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.
Ross : No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?
Ross : Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
Ross : You wanna explain that?
Ross : Ok, got the vent open.
Ross : Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben. [Ross and Susan lift Phoebe up into the vent.]
Ross : Phoebs, It's open! It's open! [Ross and Susan run to the delivery room, leaving Phoebe dangling from the vent.]
Ross : We're here!
Ross : Long story, honey. Dr.
Ross : Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Ross : [puts his head near the baby] Hello! [to Dr. Franzblau] Oh, sorry.
Ross : We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.
Ross : Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jello.
Ross : Oh, thanks, Pheebs! [They look up towards the vent and wave at Phoebe.] [Scene: The delivery room. Carol is holding the infant.]
Ross : [thinking] How 'bout Ben?
Ross : We uh, we just cooked it up.
Ross : Hey.
Ross : [to Ben] I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody.
Ross : The head, the head. You gotta...
Ross : Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. [walks out of the picture] But I'll still always come back, like this. [returns] And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. [walks away] But I'll still always come back, like this. [returns] [Chandler comes into the picture.]
Ross : No, this is pretty much it. [long moment of silence]
Ross : All right, I'll see you guys later. [They all leave but Ross, but they all come back a few seconds later. They make faces at the baby.]
Ross : And here's little Ben nodding off...
Ross : [quietly] That would be nice. [Chandler, annoyed with Ross's fawning, makes a 'pfft' noise.]
Ross : [overhearing] What kind of research?
Ross : Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. [everyone's interest is piqued, they all look over]
Ross : Hey.
Ross : Hey. [Phoebe sees his bags]
Ross : I'm going to China.
Ross : Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo--it's--it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary [hands a sheet of paper to Monica]. Um... here's a picture of me... [hands it to Monica]
Ross : [to Monica]: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Ross : Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Ross : Oh. [pause] Hey, who's Carl?
Ross : No.
Ross : At the coffeehouse, right.
Ross : OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Ross : Hi.
Ross : [sigh]....I have to go to China.
Ross : No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Ross : Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Ross : Yeah... I guess. I don't--I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? [gives Chandler a gift for Rachel]
Ross : I know.
Ross : [something in Chinese] Flight
Ross : Ni-chou chi-ma! [walks onto jetway] [Rachel runs into the airport, trying to catch Ross, moving people out of the way.]
Ross : I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Ross : Fine, just stop thinking about me. [She tries, and Ross disappears momentarily. He reappears, standing closer to her.]
Ross : Can't do it, can you?
Ross : I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Ross : Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Ross : No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
Ross : I know.
Ross : Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Ross : [pause] No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Ross : Well, start looking. [They kiss. Ross walks away, and then fades out.]
Ross : Oh, hey, hey, I got that. [Ross picks up the bag... then he and the woman (Julie) kiss.]
Ross : No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Ross : Rache!
Ross : It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
Ross : You're bleeding.
Ross : Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
Ross : That's all right, Rache, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica, Chandler, Joey. Everyone, this is Julie.
Ross : And bus.
Ross : You gotta hear this story.
Ross : But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Ross : Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
Ross : Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Ross : Hey, Rache, can I get some coffee?
Ross : Thank you.
Ross : I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
Ross : It was you, pal.
Ross : Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Ross : I didn't order lemonade.
Ross : But--
Ross : How is that the silver lining?
Ross : Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
Ross : Hello? Hi.
Ross : Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either. Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y--
Ross : Rachel! I'll just call her back.
Ross : Hi. Sorry we're late but we were--well, there was touching.
Ross : Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
Ross : So, uh, he's back.
Ross : No, not a problem.
Ross : How's the hair?
Ross : Hey, what's goin' on?
Ross : What?
Ross : what?
Ross : Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Ross : I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Ross : Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rache.
Ross : Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Ross : What's goin' on?
Ross : Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Ross : Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
Ross : What are you guys doing?
Ross : Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
Ross : This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
Ross : Hi, honey.
Ross : Hello to the rest.
Ross : So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Ross : It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Ross : Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Ross : My mommies love me. That's clever.
Ross : Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Ross : It's breast milk.
Ross : Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Ross : No!
Ross : Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Ross : I did not freak out.
Ross : Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Ross : No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Ross : That would be no.
Ross : You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Ross : Oh, you've tasted it.
Ross : Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
Ross : I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
Ross : Not hating Yanni is not a real reason. (knock)
Ross : We'll give you Janice.
Ross : Sure, sweepin'. You never know. Mr.
Ross : Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?
Ross : You don't believe in evolution?
Ross : Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?
Ross : Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.
Ross : You uh, you don't believe in gravity?
Ross : How can you not believe in evolution?
Ross : Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.
Ross : You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.
Ross : Well, there you go.
Ross : Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Ross : Please tell me you're joking.
Ross : No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--
Ross : Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Ross : You remember Janice, right?
Ross : Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Ross : It's the only possibility, Phoebe.
Ross : There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.
Ross : What?
Ross : You comin'?
Ross : Man, I sure miss Julie.
Ross : You ever figure out what that thing's for?
Ross : I know.
Ross : Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
Ross : Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Ross : (on phone) Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Ross : Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
Ross : I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
Ross : That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
Ross : Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
Ross : Go.
Ross : Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
Ross : Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
Ross : Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
Ross : That's fine, I'll just wait!
Ross : Monica! (glasses clinking)
Ross : Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
Ross : Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Ross : That sounds great. Same for me.
Ross : (using calculator) Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
Ross : Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
Ross : Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
Ross : So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
Ross : Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
Ross : Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
Ross : I hear ya.
Ross : I, I just never think of money as an issue.
Ross : That's a good point.
Ross : Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
Ross : G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
Ross : Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
Ross : No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
Ross : Not at the concert.
Ross : Whoo!
Ross : But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
Ross : Come on.
Ross : Could you be less enthused?
Ross : We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
Ross : I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
Ross : Fine.
Ross : Chandler!
Ross : Geez! Are you ready?
Ross : Whoa! You had sex today?
Ross : Wow.
Ross : Still doing the screening thing?
Ross : (silently mouthing) Bumpy?
Ross : Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
Ross : Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Ross : Excellent, that was excellent.
Ross : What guys? Oh, yeah.
Ross : Ross.
Ross : Hey, you guys.
Ross : Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
Ross : Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Ross : It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
Ross : Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
Ross : Hi guys.
Ross : Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?
Ross : [reluctantly] Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
Ross : Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.
Ross : Uh huh.
Ross : Yep.
Ross : Hopefully.
Ross : Hey Rach.
Ross : Oh. And how was the date?
Ross : Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?
Ross : OK. Oh, oh, oh. [runs over and picks up the cat toy]
Ross : No, I stayed at Julie's last night.
Ross : Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
Ross : Rach, I got a message from you. [pauses] Who's Michael? [Rachel comes out of her room, suddenly she remembers leaving the message.]
Ross : You're over me?
Ross : Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Ross : When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Ross : You've had feelings for me?
Ross : Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Ross : Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
Ross : China.
Ross : Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
Ross : [doorbell buzzes] That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. [talks on intercom] Hi Julie.
Ross : [perky] I'll be right down.
Ross : Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.
Ross : Cat. [leaves] [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Joey is watching a rabbi play an electric guitar on TV. Phoebe enters.]
Ross : I didn't get a cat.
Ross : No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
Ross : You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Ross : I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Ross : Then you should have said something before I met her.
Ross : There was never a good time.
Ross : Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Ross : The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Ross : Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Ross : Fine.
Ross : Good.
Ross : Try the bottom one. [She opens the door and they kiss.] CLOSING CREDITS [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler answers the door to find Monica.]
Ross : And, uh, and then I kissed her.
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : Hi.
Ross : That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful
Ross : Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?
Ross : Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... [Rachel enters, carrying a tray]... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.
Ross : How are you?
Ross : Good. [Julie enters.]
Ross : Hi, Julie. [nervous] Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
Ross : [uncomfortable] Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
Ross : [impatient] Play it.
Ross : [to Joey] Ssshh.
Ross : I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.
Ross : Can't we just use a pen?
Ross : I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
Ross : And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
Ross : I don't know.
Ross : [long pause] She's not Rachel. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica has made food for Phoebe and Rachel to taste.]
Ross : Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
Ross : Hi.
Ross : I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
Ross : No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
Ross : Well, uh.
Ross : Really. It's always been you, Rach. [Ross and Rachel hug.]
Ross : I know, I know, it's, it's almost...[turns around, sees Chandler and Joey] What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Ross : Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat. [Ross leaves.]
Ross : Hey, someone order a coat?
Ross : He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?
Ross : No!
Ross : That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
Ross : No, you don't.
Ross : Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?
Ross : Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.
Ross : No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?
Ross : No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
Ross : No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel? [Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Phoebe are there.]
Ross : Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!
Ross : I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
Ross : [reading his list] Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben. [Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe enter, confused.]
Ross : Number six: the way you smell.
Ross : Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?
Ross : I am, uh, I am...
Ross : Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance. [Rachel opens the door.]
Ross : No?
Ross : Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
Ross : No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Ross : You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Ross : Hi.
Ross : Look, can, can you do something for me?
Ross : So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Ross : Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme. OPENING TITLES [Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Chandler, and Joey are seated at couches. Rachel is working behind the counter.]
Ross : Hey guys. Chandler, Monica, and

Ross : How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? [Rachel walks off] Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
Ross : Here, go nuts. [gives him the Slinky and goes and sits with others at the couches]
Ross : Hey guys. Chandler, Monica, and
Ross : Um, just some presents.
Ross : [childishly] OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
Ross : I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom. [Ross holds up the blouse. It is extremely tacky, with sewn-on medals hanging off of it.]
Ross : Yeah?
Ross : Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
Ross : Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
Ross : Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
Ross : Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
Ross : C'mon Rachel.
Ross : See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
Ross : C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
Ross : Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
Ross : Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. [goes to the radiator and starts turning the knob] OK, this way is on, so this is. . . [breaks off the knob] off.
Ross : No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Ross : It uhh, it won't go back.
Ross : Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Ross : OK, tip the man.
Ross : Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon. [Scene: Outside Phoebe's dad's house. The cab pulls up.]
Ross : [sitting at table talking to a girl] It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
Ross : Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
Ross : Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.
Ross : Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing. [approaches Mr. Treeger] Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas. [Gives him the cash.] Mr.
Ross : No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now? Mr.
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : You mean hardball?
Ross : Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting? Mr.
Ross : Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
Ross : Are you OK?
Ross : You got me a cola drink?
Ross : Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
Ross : I don't want to.
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.
Ross : [sullenly] Hiiiiii.
Ross : Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?
Ross : Don't toy with me. [Fun Bobby enters from Monica's bedroom.] Fun
Ross : Hey, Fun Bobby! Fun
Ross : Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
Ross : Oooooh.
Ross : Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.
Ross : What? What's wrong?
Ross : Alright.
Ross : Hi.
Ross : Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
Ross : A date.
Ross : Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
Ross : Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
Ross : Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
Ross : I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.
Ross : Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
Ross : Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
Ross : OK, well, um, have a nice evening.
Ross : [upset] She's dating. She's dating.
Ross : What do you mean?
Ross : See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.
Ross : ....................Yeah. [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Joey is making marinara sauce and filling every container in sight. Chandler enters.]
Ross : [condescendingly] Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
Ross : [to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
Ross : Oh you do, do you?
Ross : Of... of what?
Ross : Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
Ross : No, no, let me finish.
Ross : No, you let me fini... [Rachel walks up behind them.]
Ross : Hi.
Ross : Where ya goin'?
Ross : Ooooohhhh. [Monica pulls out a bag full of airline bottles of liquor.]
Ross : What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Ross : How'd the callback go?
Ross : Good for you.
Ross : Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!
Ross : Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.
Ross : Ok.
Ross : Oh, you and me?
Ross : Ok.
Ross : As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
Ross : Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
Ross : No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!
Ross : Mmm hmmm.
Ross : Uh-huh. [at Rachel and Monica's]
Ross : This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
Ross : Would it matter?
Ross : I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?
Ross : If you wanna call that a reason.
Ross : Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.
Ross : Excellent!
Ross : That is so good! Do it again!
Ross : No no, that's me.
Ross : Oh, hello.
Ross : Is everything ok?
Ross : Oh my god.
Ross : Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
Ross : Hi, Mrs. Green. [He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.] Mrs.
Ross : And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
Ross : No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
Ross : What's the matter?
Ross : What?
Ross : Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
Ross : Oh my god.
Ross : It's ok. I'm sorry.
Ross : I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
Ross : Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
Ross : Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
Ross : Any time. [He doesn't want to let her go]
Ross : Yeah, can't help but.
Ross : Ok.
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : No, that's fine.
Ross : Ok. [They dance; Carol looks on lovingly.]
Ross : Well, Mon, I was married.
Ross : That commercial always makes me so sad.
Ross : I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
Ross : Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
Ross : Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
Ross : Hey guys.
Ross : Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
Ross : Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Ross : Oh my God, what happened?
Ross : I can't believe this.
Ross : Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
Ross : Zoo dollars?
Ross : I was thinkin' about it.
Ross : Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
Ross : Buddy, my monkey?
Ross : Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
Ross : That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
Ross : That guy Lipson?
Ross : No, I, I only know Lipson.
Ross : Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
Ross : Of course.
Ross : This is unbelievable.
Ross : Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Ross : But you already told me everything. [Scene: Library. Ross show up with a MonkeyShine Beer poster.]
Ross : Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
Ross : Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
Ross : Well, there goes my whole belief system. [knock at the door]
Ross : That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Ross : Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
Ross : Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.
Ross : I know.
Ross : This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.
Ross : Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey? Security
Ross : Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together. Security
Ross : Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. [Marcel doesn't react so Ross starts singing] In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. [no reaction from Marcel, Monica and Joey urge him on] In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. [Marcel looks over and everyone joins in] a-weema-way, a-weema-way..... [Marcel runs over and hops up on Ross's shoulder] [Scene: The next time at the movie set.] Security
Ross : Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante. [Marcel grabs the elephant doll and throws it to the ground]
Ross : I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
Ross : Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
Ross : Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
Ross : OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.
Ross : With mealworms.
Ross : Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Rachel are upset with each other. Phoebe is mediating.]
Ross : Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
Ross : [to Joey who's looking over a toilet stall] Joey, some people don't like that.
Ross : What? Let me see. [climbs up in the other adjoining stall]
Ross : Hi Tushie.
Ross : What happened?
Ross : Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
Ross : What? ["Looks Like We Made It" starts playing and we enter a whole sequence of Marcel and Ross having fun in the city.] [Scene: The movie set. Monica and Rachel are saying goodbye to Jean-Claude] Van

Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.
Ross : Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
Ross : Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
Ross : Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
Ross : No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Ross : Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.
Ross : [Rachel, laughing, puts a hand on the guy's shoulder] Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. [walks up in the middle of their conversation] Excuse me, are you Rachel?

Ross : Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.
Ross : KARL! [Ross leaves to find Karl. Rachel takes a peek under the loincloth of one of the display models.] [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Dr. Burke are sitting on the couch. He's showing her the pictures in his wallet.]
Ross : Rach.
Ross : I'm done.
Ross : Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.
Ross : No, no, we won't.
Ross : [grabs a fur pelt] C'mon.
Ross : Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
Ross : [spreads the pelt on the floor] OK, now, sit. OK. [he starts the music system]
Ross : Sorry.
Ross : Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.
Ross : I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Ross : You're not laughing.
Ross : What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Ross : Hi.
Ross : I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
Ross : We're not alone. [A church youth group is outside the display watching them] CLOSING CREDITS [Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. They are still in their chairs, watching Beavis and Butthead.] [they're laughing along with the show when an alarm goes off]
Ross : What? What's on your shoulder?
Ross : A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.
Ross : No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Ross : I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.' [Scene: The Gellers' house. Monica, Ross, and Richard are arriving to Mr. Gellers birthday party.]
Ross : Alright, shall we?
Ross : Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. [opens door] We're here. Mrs.
Ross : Hi ma.
Ross : Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us. [Scene: The Gellers' kitchen. Monica, Mrs. Geller and one of Mrs. Geller's friends are preparing the cake.]
Ross : Dad, you really don't want to do that. Mr.
Ross : Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence. Mr.
Ross : Mon, Mon, are you OK?
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : Eww. [Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Monica and Richard are alone in the kitchen.]
Ross : Ohh. Mrs.
Ross : Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal? Mrs.
Ross : I'll take that dad. [grabs the bat] Mrs.
Ross : You got a tattoo?
Ross : Lemme see. [looks]
Ross : Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
Ross : Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
Ross : Hey, save us some pizza. [they go off to Rachel's room] [Scene: Chandler's apartment. Chandler and Joey are playing foosball for the table.]
Ross : Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck. [Everyone except Joey and Chandler leave.]
Ross : Get out.
Ross : [looking at a glass table with a panther shaped base] Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide.
Ross : Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
Ross : Wha-, you have a phone in here?
Ross : Get the what?
Ross : I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7. [swats at an imaginary insect by his head, guy leaves promptly] [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica is outside the bathroom yelling at Ross who's in the bathroom.]
Ross : Calm down, I'm blow drying. [Rachel enters with laundry and starts folding]
Ross : [comes out] All yours.
Ross : [in a childish voice] I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Ross : [childish voice] Shut up.
Ross : [childish voice] Mi-mi-mii. [Monica goes in the bathroom]
Ross : I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
Ross : Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
Ross : No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore. [Scene: Recording studio. Phoebe is getting ready to record Smelly Cat.]
Ross : No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. [Monica comes out of her room] Oh, were you takin' a nap?
Ross : Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. [gets the other line] Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. [hangs up the other line] Call Joanna. [back on with Tony] Hi.
Ross : Did you see me write one down?
Ross : Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
Ross : Look, you wanna get off my back?
Ross : Wait hold on Tony, hold on. [answers second line] Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. [gets first line] Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.
Ross : OK.
Ross : Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
Ross : I know.
Ross : Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti.
Ross : Wha-, oh, quit it.
Ross : Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel.
Ross : Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Ross : Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
Ross : Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Ross : Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Ross : You hated me when we were kids?
Ross : Why did you hate me?
Ross : And that wasn't fun for you?
Ross : I can't believe you hated me.
Ross : Really?
Ross : I can do that.
Ross : So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
Ross : What?
Ross : Ohh... OK. [changes the channel] [Scene: Central Perk. Ross, Rachel, and Monica are hanging out.] [Phoebe enters]
Ross : What woman?
Ross : I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
Ross : Well, we should probably get going.
Ross : My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Ross : G'night.
Ross : Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Ross : C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Ross : Better not be doin' these in order.
Ross : Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Ross : Really?
Ross : Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
Ross : Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Ross : Knock-knock.
Ross : Until now. [jumps on Rachel on the bed] [later in the bathroom Monica is looking in the drawer, Rachel runs up]
Ross : [comes out of the bedroom] Rachel. [growls then sees Richard standing there] Hey.
Ross : Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
Ross : Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
Ross : Oh. And what do you call that?
Ross : So were you in Nam?
Ross : No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
Ross : What, what oh....[Ross and Rachel go into her room]
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : Yeah.
Ross : No. [sound of Dr. Remore's body hitting the bottom of the shaft] Now maybe. [Scene: Joey's apartment. Everyone is outside knocking.]
Ross : C'mon.
Ross : Open up. We want to talk to you.
Ross : How could you not tell us?
Ross : Hey.
Ross : Hey.
Ross : Oh man.
Ross : Hey you guys.
Ross : Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.
Ross : No?
Ross : Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
Ross : Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
Ross : You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
Ross : I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
Ross : What, what's that?
Ross : Open it, open in.
Ross : Woah.
Ross : Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Ross : What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
Ross : Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
Ross : That audition.
Ross : Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
Ross : So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
Ross : Toilet paper?
Ross : Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
Ross : I am your friend.
Ross : But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Ross : Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
Ross : Huh, I'm just saying...
Ross : Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
Ross : Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
Ross : [enters] Oh my God, what's goin' on?
Ross : No look I wasn't right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Ross : Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
Ross : Great, how did it go?
Ross : Good for you.
Ross : You're livin' the dream.
Ross : All right then.
Ross : What?
Ross : [approaching the mover holding the parrot] Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?
Ross : Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
Ross : Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
Ross : Huh.
Ross : I'll take it. My gift to you man.
Ross : I have to say "Tupelo Honey" by Van Morrison.
Ross : Hi, Mon. [Monica nods and keeps walking, looking awful.]
Ross : Nope.
Ross : Yeah. She finally stopped crying yesterday. But then, she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace and...
Ross : Getting it away from me would be job one.
Ross : You need to get some sleep.
Ross : Well, I'm thinking Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy. So, I say we all just be adults about it and accept her.
Ross : No, I had to return it to the costume place. I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
Ross : No.
Ross : Nope.
Ross : Okay. Uh, you ever see, um, "Return Of The Jedi?"
Ross : You remember the scene with Jabba the Hutt? Well, Jabba had as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia. [Rachel smiles, starting to understand where this is going] Princess Leia was wearing this gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool. [Scene: Central Perk. Rachel and Phoebe are sitting on the couch.]
Ross : Hey.
Ross : Look who I found standing outside the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
Ross : [to Rachel] Hi. Guess what? They published my paper.
Ross : How could you have told her?
Ross : [to the air] Oh, she didn't think it would be that big a deal.
Ross : Look, that was supposed to be like, a private, personal thing between us.
Ross : That's different. Okay. That's like "Who dated a stripper?" or "Who did it on the back of the Stanton Island Ferry?"
Ross : Yeah. [pause] You don't talk about your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you do with her.
Ross : No.
Ross : So what, you tell each other everything?
Ross : Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
Ross : I know, but it's still worth mentioning, right? [Scene: Monica's bedroom. Monica is laying in bed. Phoebe is sitting next to the bed. There is relaxing music playing and candles lit everywhere.]
Ross : [to Chandler] Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Ross : No. Chandler, everything. Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth.
Ross : Rachel says sharing's great. Supposedly, we oughta be doing it. So, you wanna?
Ross : No.
Ross : Okay, I'll go first. So, the other night, Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies. And I happen to describe a particular Star Wars thing.
Ross : Yes! Yes! [high fives] Wow! That was easy. Okay, you go.
Ross : With the belly button ring.
Ross : Your mom? Your telling me about your mom? What's the matter with you? I said share, not scare. Go sit over there. [points to table on other side of room where Chandler scampers to and puts his head down] [Scene: Joey and Chandler's apartment. Chandler is standing in the living room. Joey and Janice are returning from the "Day of Fun."]
Ross : No. It's not you, it's... [suddenly, instead of Rachel standing there, Ross sees his mother dressed in the outfit] Rachel (in mother's voice): Well, what is it? Come on, sweetie, you're kinda like freakin' me out here.
Ross : Hey.
Ross : Why aren't you guys dressed?
Ross : No. Four minutes ago, you had a half-hour. We have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
Ross : Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now. Chandler &
Ross : Really?
Ross : Hi.
Ross : Cause I'm a stupid, stupid man.
Ross : No. [turning back to Rachel] So, let's see. You're pretty close. Make-up's on, hair is done.
Ross : Yea. And that takes, what, just six or seven minutes?
Ross : [nervously] Nope. You wanna hear it?
Ross : Uh-huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey. [Phoebe walks in a very pretty yellow full-length dress.]
Ross : Hey.
Ross : You look great.
Ross : You see this? This is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe, you are my star.
Ross : You guys, you know what? It doesn't matter. Because you both have to get dressed before the big vein in my head pops. So...
Ross : That's funny. Change.
Ross : Look, I don't care. It starts at eight. We can't be late.
Ross : Look, our table is down in front. Okay, my boss is going to be there. Everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
Ross : It's old. It's definitely old. Didn't you hear the double beep?
Ross : Yeah, see Mon, listen. Listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing, and you know what I did. I got dressed. Really really quickly. Okay, there we go. There we go. [sends Monica toward her bedroom and Rachel toward hers]
Ross : No, no! Don't rub it! [shouting and clapping] What gets out hummus? What gets out hummus?
Ross : Okay, look. We have nineteen minutes. Okay. Chandler, I want you to go and change. Okay. And then when you come back, Joey will go change. And he'll have vacated the chair. Okay? Okay.
Ross : No. No. No. Not out of that. Not out of clothes!
Ross : Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... [seeing that she is picking up the phone] Okay, you're dialing. You are dialing. [Chandler comes in, dressed in his suit, and sees the empty chair. At the same time, Joey sees that he sees it is empty. They both run for the chair, but Joey lands in it first.] Richard (on machine): Hi. This is Richard. Please leave a message at the tone. [Phone beeps. Monica enters the code.]
Ross : [looking out the window] Oh, great. It's starting to rain. That'll make it easier to get a cab.
Ross : You don't know what you're wearing?
Ross : Which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes...come on, I'll just pick something out for you. [Ross and Rachel go to Rachel's bedroom]
Ross : [coming out of Rachel's bedroom with Rachel] I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
Ross : Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Ross : Not for tonight? What are you doing?
Ross : What?
Ross : What you do on your own time...
Ross : Whoa, whoa. Come on, you took his underwear?
Ross : Okay, hold on. Joey, why can't you wear the underwear you're wearing now?
Ross : Okay, uhm, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
Ross : Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve min.. [noticing that his watch has stopped] My watch stopped. Okay, see, the dinosaur tail isn't going around anymore. What time is it? It's 7:33. I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes...
Ross : [getting very anxious and upset] Just pick one. Okay.
Ross : [now very anxious and extremely upset] Yeah, pants, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet. Okay? No. No. I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay? No. No. Just do it. Go in there. Pick something out so we can go.
Ross : Thank you.
Ross : It was. It was her voice.
Ross : No. No. Tick, tick, tick.
Ross : Um, I know it says "black tie optional", but this may be pushing it a little. Um.
Ross : You're not gonna go.
Ross : How? How? How can you not be going?
Ross : Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
Ross : Right. Okay. God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
Ross : No, you're mad.
Ross : You're not going? Okay. You know, that I have to go. So, is it going to be like I'm abandoning you while you're upset?
Ross : No. Because you're not upset.
Ross : About the yelling?
Ross : Of course, the humiliating. So, we... we're okay.
Ross : Okay. Honey, I love you.
Ross : Okay. Okay. Enough. Enough with the lunging. No. I'm sick of this. I've had it up to here with you. Neither of you can come to the party.
Ross : You know what, I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. [goes over to Rachel] Look, Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I was a jerk. Okay. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there. I need you there. What can I do to show you how much I want you to be there?
Ross : Alright, welcome to an adult conversation...
Ross : What?
Ross : Okay. Okay. If that's what it takes to show you how much you mean to me and how much I want you there, then that's what I'll do.
Ross : I think this'll be fine. Vanilla milkshake. Just a vanilla milkshake...with chicken bits floating in it. [raises cup] Cheers. [puts cup to lip]
Ross : You will.
Ross : Well, yeah.
Ross : [to Joey] How 'bout instead you go get changed. [to Chandler] You give him back his underwear. I'm gonna go get a cab. I want everyone downstairs in two minutes. Monica! [Joey turns to leave and walks out lunging with Chandler in tow.]
Ross : Okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Ross : Rachel! [Rachel walks out looking beautiful in a green dress] Wow. You look...wow.
Ross : So we're a little late.
Ross : Oooh. CLOSING CREDITS [Scene: At the Museum Benefit. Ross is sitting at the table when an older gentleman approaches.] Mr. Whitfield: Dr. Geller. Sherman Whitfield. London Institute.
Ross : [they shake hands] What a pleasure. Mr. Whitfield: [sitting down at the table] I have to tell you. I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. It confirmed everything I had written.
Ross : Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
Ross : We?
Ross : Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Ross : Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
Ross : Fine.
Ross : Hi Gunther.
Ross : What?
Ross : Come on ! That's great.
Ross : Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
Ross : Nice to see you again Dr. Green. Dr.
Ross : Ugh, museum. Dr.
Ross : There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one. Dr.
Ross : Yeah, if you're really hungry. (Dr. Green stares at him) It was a joke, I made a joke.
Ross : It's not a library... Dr.
Ross : So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat. Dr.
Ross : It gives it a nice antiquey look. Dr.
Ross : Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that. (Rachel giggles at that) Dr.
Ross : Okay! (picks up a knife and pretends to stab his heart.)
Ross : Yeah. (sees the bill) Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
Ross : That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
Ross : So?
Ross : You really serve people sneezers?
Ross : Thanks again, Dr. Green. Dr.
Ross : Oh, ah, you don't need that. Dr.
Ross : The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness. Dr.
Ross : Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
Ross : I know. Dr.
Ross : Nothing I do means anything, really. Dr.
Ross : Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'. [Classroom, Joey is lecturing on facial expressions.]
Ross : Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Ross : Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall. (they go into Monica and Rachel's, and see Phoebe hopping around.)
Ross : Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Ross : Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
Ross : Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
Ross : Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
Ross : Okay, okay, okay. (hugs her) I'll get the bagels. [Monica's bedroom, Phoebe is trying to hide the bed from Monica.]
Ross : Dr. Green. How are you? (offers his hand, and Dr. Green puts his scarf on it.) Dr.
Ross : Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. Dr.
Ross : (to Rachel) Okay, that's it, I can't take it anymore.
Ross : Oh, please. Sweetie it's hopeless, okay, I'm just gonna go. (starts to leave rubbing his neck)
Ross : Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that.... Dr.
Ross : Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
Ross : Uh. Dr.
Ross : And his first name. Dr.
Ross : Oh-ho please. Ask her how? Dr.
Ross : Argue with that.
Ross : I know that! Dr.
Ross : What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either. Dr.
Ross : Hey, would you ah, would you like some juice? Dr.
Ross : Okay. (to Rachel) Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
Ross : Excellent! [Scene: Classroom, Joey is talking to his students.]
Ross : I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
Ross : Is this about Mark?
Ross : Okay, it's not, it's not.
Ross : Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, (goes to the door) let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something.. (opens the door)
Ross : (on the phone) I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
Ross : Who's that?
Ross : Is that Mark?
Ross : Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone) [The Philly.]
Ross : Yeah!!
Ross : Na-huh.
Ross : I love you.
Ross : Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)
Ross : Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
Ross : Umm, oh, hey, I don't know. How about a big one?
Ross : Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
Ross : You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down and picks up a shoe)
Ross : Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? (He's frantically throwing the cushions off of the couch looking for her other shoe) Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Ross : Yeah!

Ross : Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind the door) Rachel!!!!
Ross : Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Ross : Yes, you can, very much. (Chloe gives Ross the thumbs up while still standing behind the door.)
Ross : (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.) [Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is entering carry a large box, Monica is mopping the ceiling.]
Ross : You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
Ross : What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Ross : Yeah, but don't you think....
Ross : Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the footrest extended.)
Ross : What trail?
Ross : Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
Ross : (entering) Chloe? Hi..
Ross : You took my watch?
Ross : Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Ross : Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
Ross : You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
Ross : Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Ross : Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
Ross : Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Ross : Actually, no, we're not.
Ross : No, we're not.
Ross : No, we're not!!
Ross : Right.
Ross : Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
Ross : (entering out of breath) Jasmine?
Ross : We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
Ross : Yes, I did.
Ross : Very bad.
Ross : I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
Ross : Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
Ross : Thank you, thank you.
Ross : (angrily) Who's your roommate? [Central Perk, Gunther is wiping down the counter as Ross rushes in.]
Ross : Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
Ross : (forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!! [Cut to Monica's bedroom, Chandler slowly closes the door, and we hear Rachel from the living room.]
Ross : Rachel? [Cut to Living Room]
Ross : No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Ross : No!!
Ross : No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Ross : What?
Ross : She was... [Cut to Monica's bedroom]
Ross : She, she was different. [Cut to Monica's bedroom]
Ross : Nobody likes change. (Rachel picks up a newspaper and starts beating him with it.)
Ross : What? Okay, okay, okay, okay. [Cut to Monica's bedroom]
Ross : I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
Ross : Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
Ross : Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
Ross : That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Ross : Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
Ross : Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Ross : Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to. [Cut to Monica's bedroom]
Ross : Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
Ross : (pause) Yes I would.
Ross : (less sure) Yes.
Ross : (covering his ears and screaming) La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you. [Cut to Monica's bedroom]
Ross : What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
Ross : Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?' (She turns around and glares at him, he turns away.) [Cut to Monica's bedroom]
Ross : Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
Ross : No anchovies.
Ross : That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
Ross : You can have the last piece, if you want.
Ross : What, now you're not even taking to me? (moves over to the coffee table) Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey! [Cut to Monica's bedroom]
Ross : Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
Ross : That's what?!
Ross : Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? (sits down next to her) Look, I, (on the verge of tears) I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. (We see Monica and Phoebe are almost in tears.) I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much. (He kisses her on her shoulder, then her neck, then the side of her face, then just before he kisses her on the lips....)
Ross : Okay, okay, okay.
Ross : What?
Ross : (moving over to stand in front of her) Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
Ross : Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, (takes a hold of one of her arms.) I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. (Both of them are starting to cry.) Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, (drops to his knees and hugs her around her waist) and, and....
Ross : (crying) Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean. (Pause)
Ross : [walks down the stairs and grabs the flowers out of the vase on the endtable] OK dad.Mr.
Ross : (Ross hugs his mom and dad)Hi. Mom. Dad. Mrs.
Ross : what's up, Dad? Mr.
Ross : (Holding him back.)Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. (Picks up the bill.) Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay? Mr.
Ross : Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn. Mr.
Ross : I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face. Mrs.
Ross : Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding. Mr.
Ross : (Screaming) I'm getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!
Ross : I'm getting married, to..day!!
Ross : Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.
Ross : (Using a slightly different inflection for each.) I do. I do. I do.
Ross : (Very Nervous)Really? [Scene: Joey's in the front entrance watching for Rachel. The bridesmaid he met at the rehearsal dinner come in.)
Ross : Dad!! (Emily comes running in.)
Ross : Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control. Mr.
Ross : (Stepping in between them.)Okay! Okay! That's it!! Parents!! Parents!! Back away!! All right, this is our wedding day! From now on everyone gets along, and if I hear one more word. NO GRANDCHILDREN! (Pointing at his mother.) That's right!! Mr.
Ross : (Sighing.) It was...This disagreement over...(She sighs. Ross notices her in her wedding dress.) My god. You...you look beautiful.
Ross : You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have. (He hugs her.) (The front entrance. Joey and the bridesmaid are up against the wall kissing. Rachel comes in the door and walks by Joey unnoticed. She walks into the chapel and sees Ross and Emily kissing. She looks as though she wants to cry. Emily walks away and Ross turns and sees Rachel standing there.)
Ross : My God. Rachel! (He walks towards her, grasps her hands and kisses her on the cheek.) Your here. I can't believe it. (She giggles.) What happen? Why are you here?
Ross : I Ross...
Ross : Take thee, Rachel...(All his friends have looks of shock on their faces. He realizes what he said. Quickly he says.) Emily. (A slight chuckle.) Emily.
Ross : Are you kidding?
Ross : (skeptical) That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
Ross : She's putting words in your mouth!
Ross : Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
Ross : Dude, I wanted him to guess.
Ross : Guess where they are?
Ross : Did I do something to you?
Ross : So?
Ross : He's right, man.
Ross : We're still going at the game, right?
Ross : Yeah. [Scene: Baby beauty contest]
Ross : Oh! What a game, huh?
Ross : I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Ross : Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
Ross : I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice (Joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that) I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Ross : Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
Ross : One more fight!
Ross : Okay. [Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment.]
Ross : Forty-five minutes.
Ross : (handing him his coat) Here!
Ross : You may want to lose the foam finger!
Ross : Hey!
Ross : We're late too! (Rachel screams)
Ross : So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
Ross : Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
Ross : You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Ross : Let me see this... (he takes the trophy from Rachel's hands) Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
Ross : You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
Ross : I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
Ross : So this is an annual thing?
Ross : Yeah. What are we gonna do?
Ross : Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
Ross : (to Joey) HEY! [Scene: Monica's apartment.]
Ross : I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Ross : (sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
Ross : (Reading the note) We know you're out there. (Rachel gasps)
Ross : Well, let's just go in there and face them.
Ross : What is that?
Ross : Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
Ross : Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
Ross : (to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)
Ross : How are we gonna decide who gets this?
Ross : That's worse than no food. [cut to Monica and Chandler] (Monica looks insulted)
Ross : I don't know...
Ross : (Staring back, and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, he can do it! (Rachel finally manages to open the door, but the door chain is on.)
Ross : I feel terrible. Phoebe and
Ross : So bad.
Ross : Really girls, not cool.
Ross : It's a day to be thankful.
Ross : Yeah! Let's go out.
Ross : Okay.
Ross : I gave them to Joey.
Ross : (looking at Joey's butt) I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
Ross : Nice! (The phone rings in Chandler and Monica's apartment)
Ross : I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.

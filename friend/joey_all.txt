Joey : C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Joey : Instead of...?
Joey : Never had that dream.
Joey : This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Joey : And you never knew she was a lesbian...
Joey : Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is? (Ross GESTURES HIS CONSENT)
Joey : Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
Joey : I say push her down the stairs.
Joey : (SITTING BESIDE HER) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Joey : What, like there's a rule or something? (THE DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS. Chandler GETS IT)
Joey : Who's Paul?
Joey : Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
Joey : Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Joey : What's this?
Joey : Done with the bookcase!
Joey : Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
Joey : You got screwed. (CUT TO Monica and PAUL EATING IN A RESTAURANT)
Joey : What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavour of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavours out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
Joey : Congratulations. And while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelette or something... (Joey and Chandler TASTE THE COFFEE, GRIMACE, and POUR IT INTO A PLANT POT) Although actually I'm really not that hungry... (ENTER Monica FROM HER ROOM)
Joey : Morning, Paul.
Joey : That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Joey : Yeah, I'm an actor.
Joey : I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Joey : I will not take this abuse. (WALKS TO DOOR and OPENS IT TO LEAVE)
Joey : (PERCHED ON THE SIDE OF THE SOFA)Of course it was a line!
Joey : (BURSTS OUT LAUGHING AGAIN) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line! (Monica PUSHES HIM OFF THE SOFA. ENTER Rachel WITH SHOPPING)
Joey : I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
Joey : Probably kill myself!
Joey : Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
Joey : You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. (INTRO) SCENE 1: Central Perk (Ross and Monica ARE WATCHING Phoebe SLEEP)
Joey : ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
Joey : (TO Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
Joey : We love you, man. (KISSES HIM)
Joey : So?
Joey : What's wrong with the twentieth?
Joey : The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
Joey : C'mon, Ross!
Joey : Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
Joey : Leech spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! (KICKS IT TO Ross, BUT Ross IS STARING INTO A SHOP WINDOW)
Joey : What?
Joey : -Peaches?
Joey : Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! (THEY TURN TO STARE AT HIM) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. (CUT TO Central Perk- Rachel, LESLIE, KIKI and JOANNE TALKING)
Joey : C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. (CUT TO THE GIRLS)
Joey : Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Joey : He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Joey : What?
Joey : With Carol? (Ross GIVES HIM A LOOK)
Joey : Oh.
Joey : Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! (BALCONY)
Joey : Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
Joey : Really?
Joey : Oh, ah- the kid has it.
Joey : Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
Joey : No plans, huh?
Joey : Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
Joey : My god, Angela. [Angela takes a seat at the counter.]
Joey : No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. [he walks over to her] Hey, Angela.
Joey : You look good.
Joey : You don't say. [Cut to Ross and Rachel, talking next to one of the tables.]
Joey : Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Joey : Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Joey : What?
Joey : Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
Joey : You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica. Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. [ Joey is there, trying to convince Monica to pose as his girlfriend. His plan is to hook Monica up with Angela's boyfriend Bob and then take Angela back for himself.]
Joey : Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
Joey : Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is--
Joey : What?
Joey : Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
Joey : [proud] I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please? Scene: Ross' apartment. [ Chandler is over.]
Joey : Yep.
Joey : Which what?
Joey : No, but he's--
Joey : Oh my god.
Joey : I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not. Commercial Break Scene: Fancy restaurant. [Joey and Bob are talking.]
Joey : So, you and Angela, huh?
Joey : You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
Joey : Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
Joey : Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually. Scene: The ladies' bathroom at the restaurant [ Monica and Angela are talking.]
Joey : What?
Joey : Come on, they're close.
Joey : Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Joey : Well, who's to say what's true? I mean--
Joey : All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Joey : Ow!
Joey : Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Joey : Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up. [ Scene changes to later that night. Monica accidentally spilled her drink on Bob's shirt and is wiping it off. Joey is making eyes at Angela.]
Joey : Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here. Scene: Central Perk [ Chandler is still trying to ease things over with Janice, and there are about a dozen empty Espresso cups in front of him. He is extremely wired.]
Joey : Excellent.
Joey : Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (GOES INTO A SONG and DANCE NUMBER) All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang... (INTRO) SCENE 1: THE THEATRE (JUST AFTER THE PLAY; EVERYONE IS APPLAUDING) (AS SOON AS THE CAST HAS LEFT THE GANG All GROAN and SIT DOWN HEAVILY)
Joey : Whadja think? (PAUSE)
Joey : C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
Joey : The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
Joey : Who's Rick?
Joey : I couldn't do it.
Joey : When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Joey : Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (TO All) That was my agent. (TOSSES and CATCHES PHONE) My agent has just gotten me a job- in the new Al Pacino movie!
Joey : Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! 'I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!'
Joey : 'Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!'
Joey : ...I'm his (MUMBLES)
Joey : ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Joey : C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Joey : Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Joey : Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Joey : Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Joey : Thank you! (GOES OFF TO THE BATHROOM) (ENTER Chandler WITH A PHONE)
Joey : Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Joey : Me?
Joey : Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (TAKES IT OFF) And the robe is lost.
Joey : Well, I'm- I'm showering.
Joey : Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
Joey : I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask... SCENE 6: Chandler and Joey'S (Aurora and Chandler ARE IN BED IN Chandler'S ROOM)
Joey : Nope.
Joey : I got fired.
Joey : Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and-
Joey : My mom will.
Joey : Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Joey : Hard to tell, I was naked.
Joey : Yeah? That's so nice! (THEY HUG) (Ross and Chandler LOOK AT EACH OTHER and HUG AS WELL)
Joey : Hi everyone.
Joey : Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Joey : What's up man?
Joey : [to everyone] Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! [on phone] Chandler, listen. [says something intentionally garbled]
Joey : OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Joey : We have a winner! Scene: Time passes once again. [ Ross and Rachel are talking, Joey is on the couch, and Monica and Phoebe are out of the room.]
Joey : It's never gonna happen.
Joey : You and Rachel.
Joey : Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Joey : Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Joey : Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Joey : Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' [Rachel comes into the room behind them]
Joey : Are you going to do it?
Joey : Do you want any help?
Joey : Good luck, man.
Joey : OK. [Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel] [Monica walks in, starts to go out on the balcony.]
Joey : Hey, where are you going?
Joey : You can't go out there.
Joey : Because of... the reason.
Joey : I, um, can't tell you.
Joey : OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
Joey : He's planning your birthday party.
Joey : [as Phoebe enters] You'd better act surprised.
Joey : Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
Joey : Sorry, that was wax.
Joey : [does a maniacal laugh] Bwah-hah-hah! [Everyone starts to imitate him.]
Joey : Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica. Closing Credits Scene: ATM vestibule. [ The power has come back on.]
Joey : Not me.
Joey : Twice?
Joey : You guys okay?
Joey : Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! [Realises his tactlessness] ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
Joey : [Entering with Chandler] Morning. We ready to go?
Joey : What?
Joey : Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. [He has a pocket TV]
Joey : No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
Joey : [Hides the TV, but he still has an earphone] Just a, uh... hearing disability. Mr. Geller: What's the score?
Joey : Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third. Mr. Geller: Beautiful! [Turns to watch with him] [Time lapse. A large crowd of men are now watching the game]
Joey : Ooh, look look look look look! I got Monica naked!
Joey : Hey, hey.
Joey : Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
Joey : You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Joey : No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... [crosses fingers]
Joey : Thanks. [Ross comes back to the couch.]
Joey : Yeah.
Joey : [to Monica] We did?
Joey : Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together. GIRL: We did?
Joey : Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. [pretends to spray cologne] Aramis? Aramis?
Joey : I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
Joey : I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
Joey : Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
Joey : Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
Joey : What's wrong?
Joey : Oh. What?
Joey : Wait, wait, wait! [Joey turns around and sees his face on a poster in the subway. The poster says: What Mario isn't telling you...V.D., you never know who might have it. A variety of scenes are shown with the poster displayed all over New York City.] [Scene: Central Perk. Joey enters, amongst snickers from the gang.]
Joey : So I guess you all saw it.
Joey : Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
Joey : Chandler, will you just come in already?
Joey : Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
Joey : But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
Joey : The balloon?
Joey : Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Joey : That tone will not make me go any faster.
Joey : That one will. [Joey leaves to get the copy of the key.] [Scene: Carol's apartment. Carol is reading, Ross is talking to her stomach.]
Joey : Nope, not that one.
Joey : Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
Joey : Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
Joey : You call that delicious? (all shouting)
Joey : I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Joey : Oh, I will.
Joey : The bigger half.
Joey : Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
Joey : I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
Joey : Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
Joey : Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note! [Scene 2: Mon+Rach's apartment. Again, no Joey. The gang are decorating for Christmas]
Joey : Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late. [He removes the coat to reveal an elf costume]
Joey : Nice shoes, huh? [He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle]
Joey : You know more than one Fun Bobby?
Joey : Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
Joey : Uh, four.
Joey : Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Joey : Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! [She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl]...You brought your kids. Sandy: Yeah. That's okay, right? [Joey and Monica look at each other and shrug. Ross enters with Marcel on his shoulder]
Joey : Wow, that's, uh, dirty. Sandy: Yeah. [They almost kiss and then Joey realises her kids are staring at them]
Joey : Hey, kids...
Joey : [Approaching] Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died? [Monica gestures wildly behind Fun Bobby's back] [Time lapse. Bobby is talking about his grandfather. Everyone else is virtually in tears] Fun Bobby: It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again. Janice: [Ross is still taking their photo] Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
Joey : There y'go, kids.
Joey : You seen Sandy?
Joey : Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
Joey : Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
Joey : Alrightalrightalright. [Kisses him. Ross takes a photo] There. [Credits] [Credits scene: Still the party. Time lapse]
Joey : I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Joey : C'mon, she's your mom!
Joey : Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street. [Commercial] [Scene 5: Chandler and Joey's, morning. Joey is getting the door in his dressing gown- it's Ross]
Joey : Yeah. [Ross drags Joey into the hall and slams the door]
Joey : Right. No big deal.
Joey : In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Joey : You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom! [Chandler opens the door and startles them. He picks up the paper]
Joey : Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Joey : Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Joey : Ross, how could you let this happen?
Joey : You don't think my mom's sexy?
Joey : I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Joey : He forgot to leave his grip size!
Joey : So are you gonna tell him?
Joey : How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Joey : Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Joey : Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Joey : Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Joey : Me neither, y'know what-
Joey : What are you mad at me for?!
Joey : [Shouting after him] Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! [To Ross] See what happens when you break the code?
Joey : Ah! [Points to door] Huh? [Leaves and slams the door] [Scene 7: Central Perk- no Chandler. Rachel is writing something and Monica walks up]
Joey : [To Ross, on the couch] Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Joey : C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Joey : [Laughing] Mother-Kisser... [Sees Ross's look] I'll shut up.
Joey : Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Joey : No, no. He said 'When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?'
Joey : Then she came back with 'The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?'
Joey : That makes more sense.
Joey : I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! [Goes back to the door] I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. [Looks through the spyhole]
Joey : Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run! [Joey runs off down the hall. Ross tries Mon+Rach's apartment, but it is locked so he has to stand in the hall and pretend he wasn't listening. Chandler and his mom come out] Mrs. Bing: You okay, kiddo?
Joey : You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Joey : Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Joey : Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? [measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger] This is your baby. [in baby-like voice] Hi Daddy!
Joey : I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
Joey : Need a new table.
Joey : That's the rule.
Joey : How'd you get to that?
Joey : You knew about that?
Joey : Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
Joey : Yeah
Joey : Why not?
Joey : Why, are you moving out?
Joey : You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Joey : Aw, I know all about Kip!
Joey : Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Joey : So what's it gonna be? [Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and waves arms frantically in protest]
Joey : Or an uncle... [Phoebe enters] Joey and
Joey : Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Joey : Whoa, whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
Joey : Feminist issue. That's where I went!
Joey : Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? [points to a table]
Joey : So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course! Chandler [gesturing towards another table]: What about the birds?
Joey : I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something"
Joey : All right, how about the ladybugs?
Joey : Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Joey : Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Joey : No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
Joey : Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
Joey : Wha- Joey &
Joey : Hey!
Joey : Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Joey : Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right? All: Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
Joey : Dad, dad. [Shakes his head] Mr. Tribbiani: Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? [Ross whines and lays his head on Chandler's shoulder] Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny! [Chandler stays stone-faced] [Scene 2: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Mr. Trib is on the phone] Mr. Tribbiani: Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now-
Joey : [Snatches the phone] Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? [To his dad] Did you know this isn't Ma? [His dad nods. Cut to later. Joey is chopping mushrooms] Mr. Tribbiani: Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Joey : Sure. So how long you been... [Goes back to chopping] Mr. Tribbiani: Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
Joey : Since then?! Mr. Tribbiani: No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
Joey : ...I d'know. Mr. Tribbiani: Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
Joey : You're one to talk. [Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan] Mr. Tribbiani: Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Joey : Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma. Mr. Tribbiani: Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you. [Scene 3: Monica and Rachel's]
Joey : It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the CIA. [Considers] That'd be cool.... This blows!
Joey : What's the matter with Rog?
Joey : Night, you guys. [They notice that a woman is sitting by their door]
Joey : Hey. Can, uh, can we help you? Ronni: Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
Joey : I'm Joey Tribbiani. Ronni: Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! [Joey stares at her] I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Joey : Dad, Ronni's here. Mr. Tribbiani: Huh? Ronni: Hi. Mr. Tribbiani: Hey! Hello, babe! Wh- what're- what're you doing here? Ronni: Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting. [Hands him the hair] Mr. Tribbiani: Thank you. Uh...
Joey : Whoah-ho. Mr. Tribbiani: We'll go to a hotel. Ronni: [Shrugs] We'll go to a hotel.
Joey : No you won't. Ronni: No we won't.
Joey : If you go to a hotel you'll be.. doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you. Mr. Tribbiani: You're gonna keep an eye on us?
Joey : That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend. Ronni: Wow. He's strict.
Joey : Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni- uh, you can stay in Chandler's room. Ronni: Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
Joey : Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough. Mr. Tribbiani: What kinda change?
Joey : Well, either you break it off with Ronni- Mr. Tribbiani: I can't do that!
Joey : Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right! Mr. Tribbiani: Yeah, but this is-
Joey : I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room! [Scene 6: Chandler and Joey's, night. Chandler and Joey are sharing the sofa-bed in the living room. Joey is restless]
Joey : Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Joey : I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Joey : Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Joey : No.
Joey : You really think so?
Joey : Thanks, Chandler. [Snuggles up to him]
Joey : [Runs out in a towel] What's the matter with you?!
Joey : Ma! What're you doing here? Mrs. Tribbiani: I came to give you this [Gives him a bag of groceries] and this. [Whacks him round the ear]
Joey : Oww! Big ring! Mrs. Tribbiani: Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. [She gives the sofa-bed a tiny push and it folds away]
Joey : Hold on, you-you knew? Mrs. Tribbiani: Of course I knew! Whaddyou think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. 'I'm sleeping over at my accountant's'- I mean, what is that? Please!
Joey : So then- how could you- I mean, how could you?!- Mrs. Tribbiani: Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
Joey : Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you? Mrs. Tribbiani: Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
Joey : I'm...happy...for you? Mrs. Tribbiani: Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Joey : Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want. Mrs. Tribbiani: I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
Joey : Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is. Mrs. Tribbiani: That's sweet. Could I take her?
Joey : With this ring? No contest. [Scene 9: Central Perk. Phoebe is there with Roger] Roger: What's wrong, sweetie?
Joey : Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
Joey : Yeah, I guess. It's just- parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
Joey : Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. [He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica in a towel]
Joey : Sorry. Wrong boobies. [He leaves. Cut to Monica entering Chandler and Joey's apartment. She sneaks up to the shower door]
Joey : I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
Joey : You're in!
Joey : Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
Joey : Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
Joey : Think it'll work?
Joey : Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Joey : No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Joey : Pathetic mess? I know, but--come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! [Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.] Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
Joey : [Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife] How do I look?
Joey : No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Joey : [at the urinal] Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Joey : Good for you. [jumps suddenly] Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Joey : [to Lorraine] We can't do that.
Joey : Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there? [Chandler and Joey leave the table.]
Joey : Uh, we might be leaving now.
Joey : She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
Joey : You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Joey : I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
Joey : [in disbelief] Whoa.
Joey : I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Joey : [to Chandler] If you don't do it, I will. [Scene: The Chinese restaurant.]
Joey : So what're you going to do?
Joey : How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Joey : [aside to Ross] So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... [gestures with hands, back and forth] huh-huh?
Joey : I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal. [Scene: Cut to Ross' apartment. Marcel is hanging from Celia's hair, and she is screaming, trying to get him off.]
Joey : [tasting] Mmmm. Good.
Joey : It's creamier.
Joey : I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know? [Chandler kicks open the door, angrily. His clothes are askew, he looks beat.]
Joey : Uh-oh.
Joey : [in disbelief] Vulva?
Joey : [sarcastic] Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Joey : What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Joey : Why not? Come on! Close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
Joey : ....yeah... what else?
Joey : [walks to catch up to him] Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Joey : Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! [in a low voice] Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Joey : Alright, now you say something.
Joey : Come on! You like this woman, right?
Joey : You want to see her again, right?
Joey : Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Joey : [turning around] Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Joey : There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Joey : Say it... say it!
Joey : Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Joey : And again, and again, and again... [phone rings, he answers] Hello? [hands phone to Chandler] And again.
Joey : What a tool!
Joey : [to Ross] So, er... how did it go with Celia?
Joey : All right, Ross!
Joey : Whoa! And the... [gestures with hands] huh-huh?
Joey : You cuddled.
Joey : Yeah, where the hell is he? [Scene: Chandler's office. He's on the phone, agitated.]
Joey : There's the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
Joey : No, no how come are you working here?
Joey : No no no!
Joey : I'm sayin' I see a difference.
Joey : I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's--hot!
Joey : Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Joey : Nope.
Joey : Nope.
Joey : Not from where I was standin'.
Joey : I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, and she brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries.
Joey : She is so hot.
Joey : Pheebs? You think it would be ok if I asked out your sister?
Joey : So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there.
Joey : Cool, thanks.
Joey : Hey. (knock)
Joey : Phoebe, could you do me a favor? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
Joey : Oh, no no no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size wise.
Joey : Yep. Ice Capades.
Joey : I don't know. I like her, you know. She's different. There's uh, somethin about her that--
Joey : Hey, Phoebe, I asked you and you said it was ok.
Joey : Ok, well maybe now I'm not ok with it not being ok.
Joey : Out.
Joey : Yes.
Joey : Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, ok? You meant sex, right?
Joey : That's nice.
Joey : Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Joey : He should take the sack?
Joey : Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Joey : I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Joey : When's that?
Joey : Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Joey : What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
Joey : Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Joey : Hey.
Joey : Your sister stood me up the other night.
Joey : I've been trying for two days. When I call the restaurant, they say she's too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
Joey : Urs, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
Joey : No, no, no, don't say "listen". I know that "listen". I've said that "listen".
Joey : I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
Joey : You don't drink
Joey : Urs--
Joey : Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
Joey : No. No, I, I couldn't do that.
Joey : Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
Joey : I know. I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
Joey : Pheebs?
Joey : We just got the message.
Joey : Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few. Credits [Scene: Central Perk. Ross and Chandler are sitting at a table. Rachel is working. Monica and Phoebe enter.]
Joey : Shut up!
Joey : Thank you.
Joey : There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?
Joey : Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.
Joey : Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz--[look of realization]
Joey : About what?
Joey : Heh... I was bluffing.
Joey : You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?
Joey : [pause]...Yeah?
Joey : No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Joey : Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.
Joey : But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Joey : What?
Joey : Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. [gets up]
Joey : That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
Joey : Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
Joey : Me too. Alright, whattaya got.
Joey : Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face. [the girls look at him, confused] Oh, I'm out.
Joey : Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this.
Joey : Check.
Joey : That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What? [Ross looks at Joey, dumbfounded at his stupidity.]
Joey : Here, I got five, I got five. [Ross takes the money]
Joey : [to Ross]: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Joey : Oh!
Joey : [triumphantly] The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
Joey : Suck-fest.
Joey : Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
Joey : I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking. Monica and
Joey : I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
Joey : She really said that?
Joey : 'Tonight' tonight?
Joey : How could you lose him?
Joey : Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
Joey : Marcel?
Joey : Marcel? [They come to a door and silently agree to try it. A very sweaty woman emerges] Woman #1: Hi, can I help you? [Chandler and Joey are dumbstruck for a moment]
Joey : A monkey.
Joey : Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way? Woman #1: Of course.
Joey : Oh. Then, no. [Another sweaty woman comes to the door and speaks to her friend] Woman #2: Did I put too much rum in here? [Joey and Chandler shoot each other glances] Woman #1: Just a sec. [To Chandler and Joey] Hope you find your monkey. [She starts to shut the door]
Joey : Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Joey : We can't, alright? [To the women] We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out. [The women quickly shut the door]
Joey : Marcel?
Joey : I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Joey : No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
Joey : Her answer machine?
Joey : Duh, where've you been?
Joey : Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Joey : Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Joey : Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters. (A PAUSE AS THEY LOOK AT Chandler)
Joey : Maybe she never got your message.
Joey : He's back! The peeper's back! (ENTER Rachel FROM HER BEDROOM)
Joey : (DUCKING) Get down!
Joey : (INTRIGUED) Yeah?
Joey : ..Naughty!
Joey : Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or- (EXIT Rachel, SLAMMING DOOR IN HIS FACE) That's fine, yeah... (EXIT Joey)
Joey : (WATCHES THEM FOR A WHILE) Oh my. SCENE 7: Monica and Rachel'S (Phoebe and Ross ARE DOING CRossWORDS. Monica IS COOKING. Chandler IS STILL STARING AT HIS PHONE.)
Joey : Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Joey : I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
Joey : Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Joey : (TO Monica) Can I use your phone? (ON PHONE) Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
Joey : Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? (TO THE GANG) Sidney's a woman.
Joey : Yeah. Yeah, so what? (TO PHONE) Look, I live across the street, (WALKING TO WINDOW) and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like- Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... mostly free weights, but occasionally..
Joey : (STILL ON PHONE) Yeah, my neighbour... Yeah, the brunette... (TO Monica) She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress.
Joey : Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.
Joey : Big day. CLOSING CREDITS SCENE: Central Perk (All PRESENT)
Joey : All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...
Joey : How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Joey : No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Joey : Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. [Waitress looks at him funny] Which I'm not.
Joey : Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Joey : [Writes it down] Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Joey : Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Joey : Hey.
Joey : Where've you been?
Joey : [To Chandler] Hey! He beat ya.
Joey : I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
Joey : Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Joey : How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Joey : Did you call the cops?
Joey : You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Joey : Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Joey : Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Joey : He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Joey : We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing-
Joey : I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Joey : Marcel, I'm hungry.
Joey : Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio. Casting Director #2: Name?
Joey : Exellent dream score.
Joey : I don?t know. What are you wearing? [Chandler, Monica and Phoebe looks at him]
Joey : Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
Joey : What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Joey : How young is young Ethan? Young?
Joey : Whoa!
Joey : Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn?t mean... [Ross?s beeper goes off]
Joey : All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool. [Ross dials a number on his cellular phone]
Joey : Services? Oh, services.
Joey : Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Joey : Oh... Yeah, you do.
Joey : [reaches for hi scones] My scones. Phoebe, Joey &
Joey : All right.
Joey : So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
Joey : What?
Joey : Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest "Power Ranger" is? [Ross and Chandler laughs]
Joey : Stegosaurus!
Joey : What about Andre?
Joey : They?re here allready? [Rachel, Ross and Ross go to the bathroom]
Joey : Uh, moist, yeah.
Joey : All right, all right. [he comes out from their apartment with a huge sandwich in his hand]
Joey : For the ride.
Joey : All rihgt, I?m going. I?m going. [They all go down the stairs, but Ross turns around, looking like his in a coma. The others also turns around to get him.]
Joey : Do we have to know about that?
Joey : I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.
Joey : [to the screen] Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, or just fall down. That's good too. [A young pregnant woman (LYDIA) enters.]
Joey : Oh, yeah.
Joey : Hey, listen, lady....[sees that she's pregnant]...whoa.
Joey : Oh yeah? And who do you like?
Joey : The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?
Joey : Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!
Joey : Oh, oh, oh, sorry.
Joey : Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here.
Joey : Tribbiani.
Joey : [takes phone] Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends. [pause] Yeah, I'm single. [pause] 25. An actor. [pause] Hello?
Joey : Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Joey : Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Joey : Good luck, and uh, take care, huh? [He leaves, but then returns a moment later.]
Joey : You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
Joey : Oh, it is.
Joey : It is.
Joey : Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
Joey : [panicked] Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Joey : Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's-- [notices the nurse looking at him strangely] I was just--yeah, right. Push! Push! [Scene: The broom closet. Ross has picked up a vacuum and is holding it at the door.]
Joey : Oh, just had a baby.
Joey : Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Joey : Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.
Joey : He doesn't do much, does he?
Joey : Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Joey : I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Joey : Well... I'm helping out down at the NYU Med School with some... research.
Joey : Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Joey : [sigh]... It's a fertility study. [Rachel laughs.]
Joey : Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Joey : We make fire. Cook meat.
Joey : Oh, OK.
Joey : I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Joey : What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Joey : Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Joey : Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Joey : Hey!
Joey : The country?
Joey : Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Joey : He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Joey : Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Joey : We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. [Joey gives Ross a hug]
Joey : Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Joey : Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I-- [Monica rolls her eyes.]
Joey : Then you do. Heh, heh.
Joey : What do you mean?
Joey : Not following you.
Joey : [to Rachel]: That book got me through some tough times.
Joey : [pats Chandler on the leg] That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time. COMMERCIAL BREAK [Scene: Same as before, a few moments later.]
Joey : Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Joey : The country.
Joey : He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Joey : Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Joey : [panicked] Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
Joey : Sure! Why not?
Joey : How do you mean?
Joey : Shhhh!
Joey : She's still asleep.
Joey : Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Joey : Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Joey : It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Joey : I know! Neither did I! [Scene: Monica's apartment, one week later. Monica is seated, Rachel comes out of her bedroom.]
Joey : Seven hundred bucks!
Joey : Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Joey : What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? [Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.] [Scene: The balcony of Monica's apartment. Rachel is having drinks with her date, Carl.]
Joey : Um, this?
Joey : Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie.
Joey : Needs some clothes altered?
Joey : Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
Joey : You know, I think I was sixteen.
Joey : No no no no no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
Joey : Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Joey : Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey says hello. He'll know what it means.
Joey : Can we see her?
Joey : How're you doing?
Joey : Ooh, that bad, huh? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
Joey : You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Joey : What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Joey : Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Joey : Frankie? What're you talking about?
Joey : No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Joey : That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Joey : What? That's not? Oh my god.
Joey : Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
Joey : I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
Joey : I gotta get one, too.
Joey : Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
Joey : Uh, does it hurt?
Joey : Chandler?
Joey : Ok, I got one, I got one. If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger? OPENING TITLES Julie: Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
Joey : Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Joey : Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
Joey : Who?
Joey : What's he doin' in my section?
Joey : Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
Joey : Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
Joey : Yeah. Bijan for men?
Joey : Bijan for men? Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work we could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
Joey : Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men?
Joey : What is the big deal?
Joey : Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--
Joey : Exactly.
Joey : Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Joey : Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
Joey : I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Joey : Yeah I guess you're right.
Joey : I'm gonna do it.
Joey : Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
Joey : Yeah, I'm ready.
Joey : These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
Joey : Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
Joey : You guys are messin' with me, right?
Joey : That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
Joey : "Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
Joey : Such as?
Joey : Check this out. Can I have this?
Joey : Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Joey : Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
Joey : "Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
Joey : That's what it says.
Joey : What?
Joey : So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
Joey : Have you been here all night?
Joey : Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Joey : All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
Joey : Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
Joey : I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
Joey : Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Joey : You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Joey : Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
Joey : Geez, look how fat she got.
Joey : Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
Joey : You want his yearbook?
Joey : Oh, yeah.
Joey : Do we need a cake?
Joey : All right.
Joey : Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
Joey : Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
Joey : For Ross.
Joey : Hi.
Joey : If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Joey : Yeah, someplace nice. (to Phoebe and Rachel) How much do you think I can get for my kidney? (at Central Perk)
Joey : Cool.
Joey : Sorry, sorry.
Joey : What are these, like famous chickens?
Joey : Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
Joey : Thank you.
Joey : Yeah.
Joey : Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
Joey : 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Joey : Yeah.
Joey : Thanks.
Joey : Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
Joey : Charity.
Joey : Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
Joey : Me too.
Joey : Fine.
Joey : Come on you guys, one more time.
Joey : Nooo.
Joey : Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
Joey : You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Joey : And we don't work hard?
Joey : And you feel like we hold you back.
Joey : Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?
Joey : The guy still won't put out, huh?
Joey : Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.
Joey : Maybe he's. . . gay.
Joey : Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?
Joey : But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?
Joey : [to Ross] You're getting a cat?
Joey : What?
Joey : Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Joey : Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
Joey : Hey Phoebs.
Joey : I can't find the remote. [Phoebe turns off the TV] Thank you.
Joey : And?
Joey : All right Phoebs, way to go.
Joey : So, so how did it happen?
Joey : And what did he say?
Joey : Wow.
Joey : Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Joey : This man is my God. [Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is closing up and Ross comes in. Get your Kleenex.]
Joey : Tongue?
Joey : Cool. Opening Credits [Scene: Central Perk. Joey, Pho ebe, Monica, and Chandler are there; Chandler is showing everyone his new computer.]
Joey : [reading over her shoulder] Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
Joey : No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then... [rubs his fingers together] [Ross enters, distraught.]
Joey : You got all that from saline solution?
Joey : Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
Joey : Hey, here's a thought, Ross. [reaches for the computer]
Joey : Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome. [Ross gives him an insulted look.]
Joey : Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
Joey : You could say that.
Joey : Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
Joey : [to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?
Joey : He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Joey : Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her? [Ross and Chandler stare angrily at Joey, who thinks he has come up with a good idea.]
Joey : Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
Joey : [opens the drapes] Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
Joey : Oh, yeah, I do. [He opens the window, Ross comes in, soaked.]
Joey : [quietly] I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? [Ross stares blankly at him] Maybe a little longer. [Scene: Mr. Ratstatter's office. Monica is there.]
Joey : Hey.
Joey : Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
Joey : You gave him cookies?
Joey : Oh my God.
Joey : Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this. [Joey shows them the torn-up newspaper.]
Joey : I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
Joey : Hey. [Ross approaches Rachel at counter.]
Joey : Hey.
Joey : C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
Joey : So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
Joey : Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears! [Scene: Phoebe's grandmother's place. Phoebe's grandmother is sitting at the table, reading the obituaries, and crossing out names in the phonebook.]
Joey : Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
Joey : She told us.
Joey : Monica, pigeons learn faster that you. [Ross approaches Rachel, away from everyone else.]
Joey : Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Joey : Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
Joey : Hey, here she comes.
Joey : Hey. [Phoebe runs over the curb. Joey gets in the back seat, Chandler in the front]
Joey : Hey.
Joey : Yeah, big stuff.
Joey : Hey. [Phoebe takes off, Joey and Chandler are thrown back in the seat] [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica is preparing for the party with Ross questioning her.]
Joey : Sure is.
Joey : Good luck Phoebs.
Joey : How far'd ya get?
Joey : Phoebs, what's goin' on?
Joey : Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Joey : Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Joey : Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
Joey : Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Ross, Monica, and Rachel are sitting around after the party. Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe enter.]
Joey : Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Joey : Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright. CLOSING TITLES [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey and Chandler are giving out their Christmas presents out of a cardboard box from a case of motor oil.]
Joey : Rach, these are for you.
Joey : No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
Joey : Uh-huh.
Joey : And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
Joey : I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
Joey : Here it is, here it is. [reading from newspaper] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.
Joey : Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.
Joey : No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.
Joey : When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff. [Ross enters, depressed.]
Joey : No, I'm alright man. Really. Fun
Joey : Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... [Fun Bobby picks Joey up off the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works. Fun
Joey : I just had a glass.
Joey : [realizing what everyone else did a minute ago] Ooooooh.
Joey : Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Joey : Hey.
Joey : Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Joey : With a man?
Joey : What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
Joey : Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday. Estelle :: Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?
Joey : No. Estelle :: Well, here it is. [She almost smiles.]
Joey : OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady... Estelle :: Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Joey : Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in. Estelle :: Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. [picks up the phone] Yeah, hi, Lori please. [pause] Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific? [pause] Uh-huuuuh. [pause] Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. [hangs up] [to Joey] Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her. [Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel at counter, Phoebe, Chandler, and Fun Bobby at the couch.]
Joey : Hey.
Joey : Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Joey : Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
Joey : Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
Joey : Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Joey : I've never slept with someone for a part.
Joey : Sorry.
Joey : Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.
Joey : I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Joey : Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it. [Scene: A restaurant. Fun Bobby and Monica are ordering.]
Joey : Hey.
Joey : It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
Joey : Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.
Joey : But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
Joey : Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!
Joey : Alright... I've got to go shower. [leaves] [Phoebe, Ross, Rachel, Chandler exchange money again.] Credits [Scene: Central Perk. Russ enters. C handler and Phoebe are sitting on the couch.]
Joey : It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Joey : Yes!
Joey : Are you really not going?
Joey : Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Joey : No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
Joey : Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Joey : It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Joey : There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. Mrs.
Joey : I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Joey : All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
Joey : I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
Joey : Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
Joey : Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
Joey : They didn't fight a lot?
Joey : Hey, look who's up.
Joey : I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
Joey : It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Joey : [to a wedding guest] How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? [the guy nods] I wrapped those bad boys.
Joey : I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? [They all look at Chandler]
Joey : Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
Joey : Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
Joey : No, my first fan mail.
Joey : Oh my god, I got my very own stalker. [Ross enters with a suitcase]
Joey : Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
Joey : Ah, the stalker.
Joey : Let's get out of here. [They run out and knock on Monica and Rachel's door]
Joey : OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
Joey : She's comin'. [Both run back in their apartment. There's a knock at the door.]
Joey : Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
Joey : Erica. [Scene: San Diego Zoo. Ross is at the Monkey cages.]
Joey : Yeah it is. . . what?
Joey : Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Joey : No one.
Joey : Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. [laughs hysterically]
Joey : Alright, just one. [she licks his hands rather emphatically] Wow, you're good at that. [Some guy at another table starts choking]
Joey : Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
Joey : But that's what...
Joey : Hey I- [she cuts him off with a kiss]
Joey : That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! [she starts nibbling his hand] Hey. He-hey. [Scene: Library. Phoebe is singing.]
Joey : Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
Joey : Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
Joey : Hey Erica, c'mon in.
Joey : Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
Joey : Who?
Joey : It's not what you think, that was...
Joey : Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
Joey : Somebody wanna help me out here?
Joey : 'Cause it's a television show.
Joey : I'm not Drake.
Joey : Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
Joey : Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
Joey : OK, alright, the people who threw the water. [Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Rob are sitting on the couch.]
Joey : This is amazing.
Joey : I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
Joey : Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. [guard lets them in]
Joey : Woah, dude, burn.
Joey : Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he? Director's
Joey : Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
Joey : Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
Joey : Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Joey : You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Joey : Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons. [Chandler enters]
Joey : Oooh.
Joey : Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight? [phone rings]
Joey : Forget about it.
Joey : So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities. Director's
Joey : So what're you guys gonna eat?
Joey : Ma?
Joey : Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
Joey : Are you naked in there?
Joey : Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
Joey : Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
Joey : Well, let me see.
Joey : Alright, alright. [climbs up in the next stall and looks over at Chandler] Woah, someone's flossing. [Ross enters, sees Joey in the mirror]
Joey : Chandler's wearing panties.
Joey : Can't help you, I'm not wearing any.
Joey : Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.
Joey : Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.
Joey : One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.
Joey : Aaaaagggghhhhh.
Joey : Aaaaagggghhhhh.
Joey : Aaaaagggghhhhh. Mommy
Joey : Hey.
Joey : Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.]
Joey : Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
Joey : Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.
Joey : Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me. [hands Chandler a jewelry box]
Joey : Heh, what d'ya say?
Joey : Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.
Joey : Put it on.
Joey : Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. [gets the bracelet from the drawer] You put this on, you're good to go. [puts the bracelet on Chandler] Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.
Joey : You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
Joey : If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Joey : Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
Joey : You know what the. . . [sees Chandler on his knees, holding the couch cushions]
Joey : Hey.
Joey : How come you have two?
Joey : Get out.
Joey : Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Joey : [pulls out a VCR tape] Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?
Joey : What is with your nose?
Joey : Some girl ate Monica.
Joey : Lookin' good Mr. Kotter.
Joey : Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.
Joey : Alright open your eyes. [opens his eyes to see two black leather recliners and a big screen TV]
Joey : Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.
Joey : I know.
Joey : Uh-huh.
Joey : Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. [Chandler starts to sit in one of the chairs] Not that one.
Joey : [sits down] Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.
Joey : We dare.
Joey : Woah, hey, yo. [Rachel and Ross move]
Joey : Hey, yo. [they move from out of in front of the TV]
Joey : What if we have to pee?
Joey : Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.
Joey : Hi. Chandler and
Joey : Hey.
Joey : What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
Joey : She laughed at you?
Joey : It certainly is a miracle. [Rachel enters]
Joey : Hey.
Joey : Hey, woah, hey, woah.
Joey : No, inside good, outside bad.
Joey : [uses a dentist mirror to see] Naa, she's lyin'. [Monica enters carrying food that's been delivered]
Joey : Is that the fire alarm?
Joey : Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
Joey : What?
Joey : Yeah, so.
Joey : Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Joey : Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Joey : Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash. OPENING TITLES [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Phoebe are sitting at the table, Joey and Chandler enter.]
Joey : Hey.
Joey : Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
Joey : Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Joey : So where you gettin' it?
Joey : Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Joey : Can you believe this place?
Joey : Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
Joey : Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man. Joey's
Joey : Huh? Joey's
Joey : Yeah, can you see me in a place like this? Joey's
Joey : Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Joey : Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
Joey : Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
Joey : I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
Joey : What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
Joey : Well that's how I feel.
Joey : Well then maybe I will.
Joey : Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons. [Scene: Mr. Geller's birthday party. Mr. and Mrs. Geller enter looking particularly refreshed. Monica follows looking rather pale.] Mr.
Joey : Hey.
Joey : Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
Joey : I know. Yeah.
Joey : No, we're alright.
Joey : Plastic spoons. Great.
Joey : These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
Joey : Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
Joey : I'm movin' out like we talked about.
Joey : Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
Joey : Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
Joey : Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
Joey : Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
Joey : Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Joey : Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister? [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Richard are setting the table.]
Joey : Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
Joey : Yes! And the table is mine.
Joey : Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
Joey : Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
Joey : Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
Joey : So, I guess this is it.
Joey : Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.
Joey : Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.
Joey : Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
Joey : Art.
Joey : Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.
Joey : Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?
Joey : Right, I go-, I got it.
Joey : Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. [leads them to the bathroom, gestures towards toilet, everyone stares, uncomprehending] Heh?
Joey : No no no, behind it.
Joey : That's right, I have a phone in here.
Joey : Yeah.
Joey : Hello.
Joey : Hey!
Joey : Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.
Joey : Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'
Joey : Oh, well great.
Joey : Well OK then. [oven timer goes off behind Chandler] Was that the oven timer?
Joey : Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
Joey : Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
Joey : Hey, hey, they're runnin'
Joey : I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
Joey : You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
Joey : Hey.
Joey : You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
Joey : Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. [grabs moose hat] It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?
Joey : Wow.
Joey : Oh, now it's a spare room?
Joey : Well I uh, got what I came for. [puts on moose hat] I'll uh, I'll see you guys.
Joey : Yeah, yeah he is. [leaves] [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica, Rachel, and Ross are there.]
Joey : Eddie.
Joey : Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail. [looks for the mail on the table by the door, it's not there] Where's the mail?
Joey : You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
Joey : Huh.
Joey : No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me.
Joey : So how you two gettin' along?
Joey : Great, well, I'm happy for ya. [picks up the orange juice carton and it's empty] Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice for the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice.
Joey : Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man.
Joey : Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Joey : Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
Joey : [sings] It may not be a bed of roses.
Joey : Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
Joey : Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
Joey : Page 42, page 42, page 42.
Joey : Ooh, I look good.
Joey : Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
Joey : Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that? [Scene: At a writer's desk. The writer is working on a script for Days of Our Lives.]
Joey : I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft? Delivery
Joey : They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son. Delivery
Joey : No. No way, I'm not signing that. Delivery
Joey : How can they do this to me? Delivery
Joey : I don't feel like talkin.
Joey : Hey.
Joey : I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
Joey : Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
Joey : Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Joey : No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
Joey : No, that means nothin to me. [Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment.Chandler walks in to see Eddie holding a tray of cookies.]
Joey : Hey.
Joey : Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?
Joey : Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Joey : Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.
Joey : Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee. [Phoebe enters]
Joey : Anybody want a croan.
Joey : So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Joey : No, can we get back to me?
Joey : Alright. Cab driver number two?
Joey : But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Joey : But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Joey : I'm sorry. See ya. [Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are there. Rachel has just finished reading the book.]
Joey : What is it?
Joey : See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.
Joey : It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
Joey : Oh my God.
Joey : Look at this, how did I spend so much money?
Joey : Ahh.
Joey : My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Joey : What?
Joey : That's a two line part.
Joey : So what.
Joey : Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.
Joey : Yeah.
Joey : Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.
Joey : Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
Joey : Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.
Joey : Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.
Joey : Well don't just say.
Joey : Ok.
Joey : I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there? [Scene: Chandler's apartment. Chandler peeks in the door. He doesn't see Eddie so he enters, breathing a sigh of relief. Eddie pops up from behind the bar.]
Joey : Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.
Joey : Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.
Joey : I fell down an elevator shaft.
Joey : What?
Joey : All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks. Casting
Joey : What? Casting
Joey : Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything. Casting
Joey : And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting. Casting
Joey : No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day. [gets up and leaves] [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe are sitting around the coffee table.]
Joey : Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.
Joey : They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
Joey : Thanks Ross.
Joey : I went.
Joey : I didn't get it.
Joey : What?
Joey : Huh?
Joey : [movers removing a glass parrot] Oh, not my parrot.
Joey : I can't watch this.
Joey : Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.
Joey : Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though. [Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Phoebe are sitting ignoring each other. Rachel walks up with two pieces of cake.]
Joey : Hello.
Joey : I know I would.
Joey : Hey no problem.
Joey : Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Joey : A little foos?
Joey : What happened to the foosball?
Joey : He paid a lot of money for it.
Joey : Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
Joey : I'm telling you, that girl totally winked at me. The
Joey : Morning. Hey, you made pancakes?
Joey : [grumbling] Good morning.
Joey : [angrily] Kiss her. Kiss her. [Janice and Chandler kiss.]
Joey : Bye-bye, Janice. [Janice leaves] So, when are you dumping her?
Joey : Come on, quit yanking me.
Joey : This is Janice.
Joey : Okay. Alright. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
Joey : [barges in] They're not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. They're not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Joey : Cute. This is Janice. You remember Janice?
Joey : There you go. That's the spirit I'm looking for. What can we do? Alright, who's first? Ross?
Joey : We'll call that plan B. Alright. [Scene: Rachel's bedroom. Ross and Rachel are laying in bed. Ross is working on a report. Rachel started nuzzling and nibbling on his ear and stuff.]
Joey : Wheel
Joey : Fortune. This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!
Joey : I say I am there. Cool. Oh. Is Ross going too?
Joey : [in a whiny voice] Janice... [looking up at Chandler and noticing the expression] ...cause I just, feel bad for Ross. You know, we always go together. We're like the three hockey-teers.
Joey : No...yes. God, how do I say this? Oh. You know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair?
Joey : Look, I don't hate Janice. She's just a lot to take. You know?
Joey : Hey, come on, man. Don't look at me like that. She used to drive you nuts before too. Remember?
Joey : Look. What do you want me to say?
Joey : I can't. It's like this chemical thing. You know? Everytime she starts laughing, I just want to pull my arm off, just so I have something to throw at her.
Joey : Yeah, then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Ross and Rachel are coming through the door.]
Joey : I never said hate. I was very careful about that.
Joey : And you got hate from that? You're taking a big leap there.
Joey : But, what does that...?
Joey : Okay. I'm in.
Joey : [dragging Joey toward the door]Does it have to be a whole day?
Joey : [mumbling under breath] Yeah, I know. I sleep in the next room. [Scene: Central Perk. The whole gang is there, except Joey. Monica is walking in with a box of videocassettes in a box.]
Joey : Yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. [Joey laughs and Janice laughs happily] You have got competition, buddy.
Joey : Sorry, man, I tried. I really did.
Joey : But, hey, you know the good thing is, that we spent the whole day together, and I survived. And what's even more amazing, so did she. It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.
Joey : Oh, man, that's huge. Now I know I can stand to be around her. Which means, I get to hang out with you. Which is kinda the whole point anyway.
Joey : Oh. Hey Chandler, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Joey : If it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
Joey : Oh, yeah. I always picture your mom when I'm having sex. [Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica is laying on couch watching Civil War tapes and smoking a cigar. There is a knock at the door. Monica gets up, mutes the television, and walks over to answer it.]
Joey : Alright, I got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider...
Joey : [takes a drink] Yep. It's fat! I drank fat!
Joey : We have a half-hour.
Joey : Relax, Ross. We'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
Joey : Okay. [they both remain sitting] [Rachel comes from the bathroom, out into the living room area, in her robe.]
Joey : [offering the glass of fat] Hey, Ross...want some cider?
Joey : [to Ross] Glass of fat? OPENING CREDITS [Scene: Still Monica and Rachel's apartment. Chandler has left. Just Ross and Joey; Joey is in the chair Chandler was sitting in.]
Joey : What's the matter, Ross? What, are you nervous about your speech?
Joey : Am I in it?
Joey : Whoa.
Joey : What?
Joey : How is this your seat?
Joey : But then you left.
Joey : What's the big deal? Sit somewhere else.
Joey : Actually, the last place you were sitting was in there. [points to the bathroom]
Joey : Alright, you can have the chair.
Joey : Would you look at that? [laughs] Look at that! [pulls his hand out from behind his back where his fingers are cRossed] [Monica checks the messages on the answering machine. One beep.] Phoebe (on machine): Hi, it's me. I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when you're playing this message? Phoebe (in person): Is that too spooky? [One beep.] Ross (on machine): Hi, Rach. Are you there? It's me. Pick up. Rachel! Rach!
Joey : Sorry Phoebe. Sorry Phoebe. Sorry Phoebe.
Joey : Fine with me. [Chandler sits down on top of Joey.]
Joey : Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Joey : Monica, how are you gonna do that?
Joey : Wow, what a cool job. [mimicking the answering machine voice] You have two new messages...Please pass the pie. [Phone beeps.] Monica (on machine): Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checking. So, let me know. Or don't. Whatever. I'm breezy.
Joey : Hey, you can't say you're breezy. That totally negates the breezy. [Machine beeps and begins second message.] Woman's
Joey : Now she sounded breezy.
Joey : Okay. [Joey gets up, takes the back and seat cushions from the chair, stuffs them under his arm and heads for the door.]
Joey : Well, you said I had to give you the chair. You didn't say anything the cushions.
Joey : That's right. I'm taking the essence. [barges out]
Joey : [barging in, heads toward Chandler] Where's my underwear?
Joey : Cause I'm not wearing any underwear now.
Joey : It's a rented tux. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Joey : Okay. You hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
Joey : Hey, opposite...is opposite. [barges out]
Joey : Okay, buddy-boy, here it is. You hide my clothes...I'm wearing everything you own.
Joey : Look at me, I'm Chandler... [mimicking Chandler] Could I be wearing anymore clothes? [back to regular voice] Maybe if I wasn't going commando.
Joey : You know, it's hot with all this stuff on. I better not do any lunges. [begin lunging forward and back alternating legs]
Joey : Yeah, Ross. Way to ruin it. I was just going to go get dressed.
Joey : You could drink the fat.
Joey : Yay.
Joey : Let's see what else he'll do.
Joey : Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood? (A commercial for the Mattress King, Janice's ex-husband, comes on TV.)
Joey : Booo!!
Joey : (entering) Hey, you guys!
Joey : Guess what?
Joey : I got a gig!
Joey : Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
Joey : Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
Joey : (glares at him) I know! [Mattress King, Monica and Phoebe are shopping for a new mattress.]
Joey : Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as (proudly) Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, (looks for a reaction from his students, and gets none.) I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. (looks all intense for a moment and then gasps, the students cheer him) Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along. [Monica and Rachel's, Joey is entering, Phoebe is already there waiting for the delievery guy.]
Joey : Hi!
Joey : Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
Joey : Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
Joey : Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin. (There is a knock on the door.)
Joey : Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Joey : You want me to lie to Chandler?
Joey : No.
Joey : Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
Joey : Ahh! (Joey throws a punch and just lightly taps her on the shoulder, Phoebe counters with a jab to the nose.)
Joey : Hey now! (Phoebe throws another jab, and lands it on Joey's nose, causing it to bleed.)
Joey : Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
Joey : Okay, great.
Joey : Okay.
Joey : All right. I can't see.
Joey : Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' (Does it by raising one eyebrow, and showing off the pretend fishhook.) Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. (looks all confused) And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
Joey : Hey-hey.
Joey : Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
Joey : You bet! What's the part?
Joey : Wow! That was good. That was...(points to his pocket) Tweezers?
Joey : Whoa. That was really good.
Joey : Well, I-I might've said supergay.
Joey : Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
Joey : (sadly) There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (he gets a huge round of applause from his students.) Thank you. [Mattress King, Monica is trying to return her bed.]
Joey : All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Joey : Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king. (starts to go to a back room)
Joey : (Voice Over) Previously on Friends. [A montage of scenes from The One Where Ross and Rachel Take A Break follows.] [Monica and Rachel's, Ross is eating the picnic as Rachel comes home from work.]
Joey : Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Joey : Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
Joey : Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Joey : All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. (spins the chair around so that Ross is facing him) Did you think about the trail?
Joey : (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! (slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!
Joey : Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Joey : Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Joey : Don't answer that. [Cut to Living Room]
Joey : Awful! Horrible!
Joey : She was nothing compared to you. [Cut to Living Room]
Joey : Ewwwww!
Joey : Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore. (Goes to open the door)
Joey : Why not?! (to Chandler) I'm hungry.
Joey : Yeah, we'll be fine. [Cut to Living Room]
Joey : Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.
Joey : You think I need a new walk?
Joey : Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
Joey : Whoa-ho-ho! (He looks at Chandler, who gives him a 'come on' look.) Yeah, okay.
Joey : Maybe she killed him?
Joey : What's in it?
Joey : (Looking up at the waiter)That's not food...No, I don't, no...(Taps Chandler on the shoulder.) Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like. Chandler: Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Joey : (Pointing? at Chandler.) Your different here too. Your mean in England. (Chandler throws his hands up to his head in frustration. They walk away from each other.) [Camera pans to the Geller family table. Ross, Rachel, Jack, and Judy are there.] Mr.
Joey : Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. (pointing at everyone.) But not as much as I love America. (Looking at Chandler.) Could we please..go home now? (One of the bridesmaids, Felicity, puts her arm around Joey.)
Joey : (Putting his arm around her.) I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart. [Scene: Later that evening at the rehearsal dinner. Chandler and Monica are sitting on a sofa. Chandler is covering his face in embarrassment because of the toast.]
Joey : Hello?
Joey : Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
Joey : Ahh Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
Joey : Ohh great!!!
Joey : (Confused.) But, he loves Emily?
Joey : Okay.
Joey : Hold on. Hold on. (Picking up a note pad and writing and reading the message aloud.) Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Joey : Right!
Joey : Hey.
Joey : Have you seen Monica?
Joey : (With a confused look on his face.) What?
Joey : Look we've got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him!!
Joey : I know! That's why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?
Joey : (Whispering.) Pisst, Monica. Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel. I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building and I got Chandler covering Ross.
Joey : Okay. (They both walk off to watch for Rachel.) (Ross and chandler are standing next to the alter. Ross is practicing for the wedding.)
Joey : Hey, Felicity.
Joey : Yeah.
Joey : (In a New York accent.) Fuggetaboutit. (She giggles.) How you doin?
Joey : Oh, yeah. (Back in the chapel. The parents are still fighting over the bill. Ross is refereeing.) Mrs.
Joey : (Smiling.) Ohh great!! (Putting the phone to his ear.) Hello. (He begins to escort her down the aisle.)
Joey : No, but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
Joey : No.
Joey : Ah, I'm-I'm walking down the aisle...Still walking. (Mrs. Waltham takes her place.) I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night. (Looking at the bridesmaid.) Hey! (Talking to Phoebe.) I told her "Hey." And now I'm at the front with Ross. It's Phoebe. (He shows Ross the phone.) He looks pretty mad. Uh...I'd better go.
Joey : Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
Joey : Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
Joey : Oh.
Joey : Yeah, they're great seats too!
Joey : Center ice.
Joey : So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
Joey : Dude, two times that happened!
Joey : Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
Joey : That's some gentle comedy, dude. (he and Ross leave)
Joey : Yeah!
Joey : Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
Joey : I know, yeah.
Joey : Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, (takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where Chandler should have been) I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
Joey : Ohhhh! These seats are great!
Joey : (looks at the time) Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
Joey : I don't know...
Joey : Okay.
Joey : How late are we?
Joey : Wow (He opens his apartment door and throws their stuff in.)
Joey : Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! (he raises his hands and on his right one there's a Rangers foam finger)
Joey : Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand! (Rachel, Phoebe and Emma arrive)
Joey : You are not at Thanksgiving?
Joey : We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time (he points the foam finger at the girls)
Joey : Yeah, where were you!
Joey : Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
Joey : (realizing) Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
Joey : All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
Joey : No. Here (he tears off the pocket from Ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)
Joey : (whispering) Who do you think its from? [time lapse ? they are still in the hall]
Joey : I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
Joey : (smiling from ear to ear) Ah-haah! I win!!
Joey : That's fire. Beats everything.
Joey : Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
Joey : I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (Ross picks it up) [cut to Monica and Chandler]
Joey : (holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)
Joey : (to Ross) Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
Joey : I'm telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He stares at Ross like this without blinking) I can do it.
Joey : Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing... (Monica is now smiling)
Joey : (still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
Joey : Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys? (Ross head appears above Joey's, Rachel's below Joey's and Phoebe's at the bottom)
Joey : (smiling) Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
Joey : Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
Joey : (to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!
Joey : Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
Joey : Sorry!
Joey : Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
Joey : Ha! (When Joey tries to pull back his head, he notices he is stuck)
Joey : Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
Joey : No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
Joey : (in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
Joey : Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
Joey : I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person... (Chandler gives Monica a footlong "eye dropper" with the turkey grease in it)
Joey : Oh, that smells good! (And he starts licking the grease which trickles down his face. Monica also squirts some on the other side of his face, and his tongue follows her movements.)
Joey : Okay.
Joey : It isn't working.
Joey : Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
Joey : Interesting...
Joey : I left them at the park.
Joey : It's really starting to hurt.
Joey : Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
Joey : Yeah! Come on! Joey and
Joey : (looking at himself) Man, I've got food all over me. (He licks his fingers, liking it. He offers Chandler a taste.)
Joey : Oh, I know how you feel... (Monica and Chandler are looking curiously at Joey.)
Joey : Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock!

PHOEBE  :  Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he's at Flimby's.  RACHEL  :  What's Flimby's?

ROSS  :  Yeah, kinda. It's this woman from work. I hope that won't be too weird. Will it, Rach?  RACHEL  :  No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so...  JOEY  :  But you said one.  RACHEL  :  I meant, me plus one!  JOEY  :  Okay. (to Phoebe and Chandler) Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?  ROSS  :  All right, I'll see you tonight.  JOEY  :  Okay.

CHANDLER  :  Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.  JOEY  :  The green bottle next to the shaving cream.  CHANDLER  :  Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.  (In horror, Joey wipes his next and smells it.)

PETE :  Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.  MONICA  :  Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.  (cut to Joey as Estelle, Joey's agent, approaches)  ESTELLE  :  Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!  JOEY  :  Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.  ESTELLE  :  How do you do. (to Rachel and Monica) Ooh, you two girls were outstanding! (to Joey) Did they have representation?  JOEY  :  No, they-they weren't in the play.  RACHEL  :  We're not actors.  ESTELLE  :  Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face (points to Monica) and her chest (points to Rachel) I could really put something together.  CHANDLER  :  Could I borrow it?  (cut to later)  CAILIN  :  (to Ross) Hi! Remember me?  ROSS  :  Hi! Yeah! Tommy's in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he's gonna snap. (He's watching very intently)  CAILIN  :  Ross, I'm gonna go.  ROSS  :  Go? Why?  CAILIN  :  I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.  ROSS  :  But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.  CAILIN  :  Good bye Ross.  ROSS  :  Uh, oh-ho bye.  THE DIRECTOR  :   (entering carrying a newspaper) Here we go people! (starts reading the review) Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la... Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.  JOEY  :  Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!  THE DIRECTOR  :   Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable. (Kate walks away depressed.) Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is... (stops, reads it again, and throws down the paper in disgust) Thank you, boys and girls, you've ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother's crab cakes! (starts to leave) Excuse me!!  (Joey steps in a picks up the paper, the gang all look at him.)  JOEY  :  Anyone mind if I save this?

(Both Rachel and Monica walk into their bedrooms, stop, and come back into the living room with confused looks on their faces.)  PHOEBE  :  Oh, okay, yeah. (to Monica) I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.  (They both look at each other, nod their heads 'All right' and follow their stuff into their new rooms.)  The Theatre, after the party. Joey is trying to comfort Kate.   JOEY  :  Hey! Are you okay?  KATE  :  Fabulous.  JOEY  :  Listen, drama critics they're nothing but, but people who couldn't make it as actors. You know what you should do?  KATE  :  Become a drama critic!  THE DIRECTOR  :   (entering, drunk) I am hurt! (to Joey and Kate) A plague on both your houses! (walks away)  KATE  :  By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.  JOEY  :  Oh, classy.

Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We'll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.  KATE  :  Why the Post?  JOEY  :  Oh, you didn't see the Post?  KATE  :  No. You?  JOEY  :  No. Why?  Kate's Apartment, Joey and Kate are returning from a night out on the town.   KATE  :  (drunk) So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?  JOEY  :  Oh, absolutely! You're talented and you're good looking.  KATE  :  Oh, you're sweet and cute.  JOEY  :  I know! That's why they trashed me!  (They kiss.)  JOEY  :  Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.  KATE  :  What?  JOEY  :  I, I don't get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.  KATE  :  What? So you never went out with an actress before?  JOEY  :  Kate, do you even like me?  KATE  :  Of course I do.  JOEY  :  Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?  KATE  :  I don't know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy... Why can't I just pick someone like you?  JOEY  :  Thanks.  KATE  :  You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you're just so, you're so, so... (She passes out and slumps against his shoulder.)  JOEY  :  (Checks to see if she's drooling on his shirt.) Okay. Okay, okay, hey. (Lays her down and covers her with a blanket.) There we go, let's get your feet up there. (Looks at her) Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams. (Picks up a garbage can) I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.  COMMERCIAL BREAK   Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Phoebe is STILL on hold.   HOLD VOICE :  Please stay on the line. You're call is very important to us.  MONICA  :  (entering from her bedroom) Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn't healthy.  PHOEBE  :  No, no, I'm fine, and y'know why? 'Cause of all the riboflavin.  JOEY  :  (entering, happily) Hey!  MONICA  :  Hey! Didn't you have that outfit on last night?  JOEY  :  Yeah! I stayed at Kate's, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?

And we stayed up all night talking, and now we're like totally crazy about each other!  MONICA  :  Joey, you had the night!  JOEY  :  What?

RACHEL  :  What time is it?  MONICA  :  One.  ROSS  :  One.  CHANDLER  :  7 : 15. (Monica looks at him) Watch doesn't work.  RACHEL  :  Tommy's supposed to be here soon, we're going to lunch.

I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.  RACHEL  :  Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.  ROSS  :  No, it's not just 'cause I'm jealous. (Both Monica and Chandler give him a 'Come on' look) I mean I'm not, I'm not, I'm not jealous, okay? It's... Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.

(starts to walk out and stops) (to Rachel) Well, I guess we're not going out anymore. Whaa!!!  (He leaves the gang in stunned silence.)

(sees Kate is watching, he turns Lauren so that he can talk directly to Kate, but still look like he is talking to Lauren) Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick 'cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so... I'm gonna get on this spaceship, (smoke starts pouring in from the ceiling, and a ladder comes down, with flashing, coloured lights on the side of it) and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone. But I won't have aged at all. (gets on the ladder) So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her.  (The ladder retracts, taking Joey up into the spaceship for his voyage to Blargon 7, and Kate waves good bye.)  LAUREN  :  So long, Vic! (waving good bye as the ladder retracts)

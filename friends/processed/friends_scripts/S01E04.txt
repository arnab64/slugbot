Phoebe  :  I got no sleep last night!  Ross  :  Why?  Phoebe  :  My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!  Monica  :  Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.  Phoebe  :  Thanks.  (ENTER Chandler and Joey. Joey IS COUNTING HIS STEPS)  Joey  :  ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven.

I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally- (OPENS ENVELOPE) -not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.

Monica  :  (PHONE) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? ...Yes, hold on. (TO RACH) Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.  Rachel  :  But I haven't used my card in weeks!  Monica  :  That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.  Rachel  :  They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?  Monica  :  (PAUSES, THEN, TO PHONE) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?  Rachel  :  Alright, c'mon!

Rachel  :  But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like-  Phoebe  :  Floopy?  Rachel  :  Yeah.  Monica  :  So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.  Phoebe  :  Oh, like that's a word.  Rachel  :  Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?  Monica  :  ...Pheebs?  Phoebe  :  Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.

Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
(no bones about it) You are right.  The hands are not always necessary.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
Back out?  You don't need us to get laid.  You afraid or something?
A little, but I think it'll work better as a duet.  With a tenor part.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at her store.
(a little angry) Steve!  You could at least look at me when you say that.
Is it cool?  I heard it was like an eagle, blazing in fire and stuff.
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
What the fuck is this?  You got someplace more important to be?
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
I'm on the offensive, boys.  The Sherman Tank is going back in.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?
(yells to Vicky's Dad) Hon?  Can you tell Vick to come on down for supper?
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
(beaten) I'll have to save this speech for another day.  I'm too worn out.
You know what the coolest thing is? This, right now.
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it. (hits him lightly) Way to go, Kev!
(dry) As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
I -- I don't get it, how the hell did you do that?
What ?? (he dismisses it) Whatever -- look uh, don't forget -- my cottage after prom.  On Lake Michigan.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
(sighs) I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
(with a really sexy accent) You are in my English class, no?
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
(off their looks) Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Oh, Jim!  I'm looking at the ol' family portrait, here.  Yep.  It's a good one.
Man, I just gotta get laid already! This blowjob thing is bullshit!
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
No, no that's fine. (then, to Kevin) So you doing okay?
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
Yeah.  Damn cable.  There's this nature show that I'm trying to watch.
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
(genuine) I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
You know it's just gonna be some crappy band and stupid decorations.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
I think he's trying to watch one of the illegal channels.
It was a pact .  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
Observe. KEVIN (cont'd) Excuse me.  Do you know who Paul Finch is?
Aged eighteen years. (she gives him a look) Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.
Just don't bring it up, hang low, maybe she won't mention it again.
What am I gonna do, broadcast her over the internet?
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
(smiles) I'll just say that we had a great night together.
Kevin... (very close, whispered) I want to have sex with you.
Hah!  Central sucks! (noticing Heather) Choir Chick?  What the hell are you doing here?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
And you got a keg, too, wow. (realizing) Oh, wait, I left my beer downstairs.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Do you think that "older woman" thing is true?
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
Okay...that would be cool sometime. (sees the guys gesticulating) How 'bout tomorrow?
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
(immediately sensing danger) Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
(wandering down from upstairs) What the hell are you losers doing?
Shut up and watch this, you might learn something.
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
You guys have like, seen him in the locker room, right?
(a little aggravated) Yeah, I know.  I'm working on it.
This is like the coolest thing I've ever seen.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Jesus Christ.  The dictionary?  Hell, son, I'll buy you some dirty magazines.
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
I know it's a long shot, but I figure Paul Finch might ask me.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
It was just my time, fellas, it was just my time.  Best of luck to you, boys.
Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Woah.  Does he have a date for prom yet.
Hmm.  You know that's (cracking up) really a shitty middle name!
Honey, why don't you let me handle this one.
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
"You have lost your internet connection.  Click 'okay' to reconnect." his dance.  He stops.  ALMOST
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
Vicky, shhh, you know there's no lock on your door.
Wow, that's amazing, she's probably gonna want to do it soon.
Focus on the music.  Think melody. Let the music be my guide.
(trying not to look inside) Can I come in?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot .
You're just saying that cause prom's a week away and you don't have a date.
That was awesome ! do see is the kitchen door handle rattling.  The
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
(trumping him) Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
It's all good. (He pulls out some gum) Breath check.
(nods, loving it) Actually, it's an eagle and this big python.
Look... (searching, remembers) ...Sarah.  I wouldn't go telling stories or whatever about you.  I promise.
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
Come on, I'll drop you off at your friends'.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Alright then.  It's official.  Any questions? KEVIN (cont'd) To the next step.
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
(nudge, nudge) "Deep conversation," huh?  Is that what you guys call it?
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
Stifler, fuck -- (noticing Heather, "sensitive") ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you. JIM'S DAD (cont'd) This, son, is your more exotic dirty magazine.
I know. (a beat) Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
(deep macho voice) Ohhh, tell me you're a nasty girl!
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Ringing the bell is dorky -- let's just go in.
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
You like her?  Her sponsor family lives on my block.  Why don't you talk to her?
I'm sorry, I really can't go with you...I'm holding out for someone else.
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
(shoving the rubbers into his night table) Just a minute!
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Oh, you bet he is.  Jim's quite the bookworm.
I had no idea you'd be this good!
(chastising) James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
(ribbing her) Go talk to him, maybe you can teach him how to read.
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
(into phone) Hey.  I got another question for you.
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
My man Oz, working it with the choir babes?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Did you get the flowers? (no response) What about the poem? KEVIN (cont'd) Vicky, please don't do this.
(cheery) Come on, you know the words, sing along.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Yeah...so like, what else do you do?
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
(like it's no big deal) I know.  Hey Nadia.
(repulsed) Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
(playful) Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
(to Jim) I guess we'll call you two-ply.
(snapping) Dammit!  If Sherman has sex before I do, I'm gonna be really fucking pissed.
(upset but trying to be cool) ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Hey, Jimmy.  I just wanted to say sweet dreams.
(dumbfounded) Finch hasn't done a damn thing, and he's got girls lining up already.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
So, I guess you and Sherman are pretty close.  You met at that party a while back?
(snippets of conversation) ...I'll never forget...thank you.
Oh, well... (noticing Heather looking at him, he acts "sensitive") It came from the heart.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
(eyes tearing) Son.  That's the best damn story I ever heard.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
(interrupting, hand up) Thank you, dad, I got it.
No, go right ahead and get dressed. I'll just be downstairs, studying up. Get me when you're ready.
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Looks like you could use an extra hand.
You know, after I graduated high school, my parents let me do some traveling...
James, don't speak that way to your mother!
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
(barely, overwhelmed) I suppose that would be okay.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Hey, we've got Conan the Barbarian singing with us.
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
This is pathetic.  I'm gonna find me a little hottie. STIFLER (O.S.)(cont'd) (yelling) Suck me, beautiful!
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
(getting really turned on) More, more, you bad boy!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
(brushing it off her skirt) Whoops, excuse me...
About the other day...I've been thinking.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.  Knocked out a tooth, but you can't see it.
(going on) The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
Woah, no way!  That guy is so cool!
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
These are for you.  From father to son.
I'll give you a hint. (hot, orgasmic) "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!" (flat) Comprende?
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean really fast.
At least I learned how to shit in school.
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
(subtitled) He knows how to treat a woman.
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
A foolproof plan, my friend.  You shall see.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
The difference is so phenomenal, I can't decide.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
How did you know I was here?
She's around.  Seems that she's taken a liking to me.  Fellas, it's time that she experienced -- The Sherminator.
Is it true that he's really...huge?
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is really old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
You can send me the address too.
Okay. (a beat) Did you bring a condom?
No wonder she never pays attention in class.
If I might ask, when you brush your teeth, do you spit or swallow?
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
I don't get it, that really works?
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Maybe he'll crush some beer cans on his forehead.
It is far away...and we'll be on our own...meeting new people...
Oh gosh, I forgot -- you uh, you look okay...I mean you can't even tell...
No, of course not, don't be ridiculous.
Of course!  Have you guys seen his tattoo?
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Do you commonly grasp warm pieces of stool?
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
M-I-L-F!  Mom I'd Like to Fuck!
(deadpan) I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you? KEVIN (cont'd) (into phone) Hello?  Hey Sherman...what?!  How did you know?
Just tell her what's on your mind. And smile, you've got a good smile. (then to Kevin) Come on.
Just a second! VICKY (cont'd) (a little too loudly) Oh, God! VICKY (cont'd) Moly shmmmt!  Fmmkkkk!
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
(singing happily) ...I needed the shelter of someone's arms...there you were -- woo-hoo- hoo...
Go ahead son, there's more. JIM'S DAD (cont'd) Now, that one's a little more...a little more...graphic.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
I want to hear you say it.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
(to Jim) You guys got the Latin homework?
I highly recommend you join the club.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin. (she turns to him) But I did pick it up from you.
I think he's got a nice voice.
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
First of all, it's Mocha ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
That's the next book, Kevin.  That's the next book.
You guys are gonna fuck, aren't you!?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
So we're gonna be close next year?
Okay.  I'm here for your dumb...dumb meeting.
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. (a beat) So I guess...I'll see you later.
She's gone. JIM (cont'd) Oh my God.  She used me. JIM (cont'd) Wow!  I was used!  Cool!
(trying to decipher the guys' signals) Yes.  No.  Yes.
I can't believe Oz had to work.
(pause) You can't sing at the competition.
Hey, that guy's in my trig class.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
(hysterical, toppling over) You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
Still questing after the holy grail, eh guys?
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
(getting ticked) Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
That's not why we're going out.
I do like your dirty magazines.
(gives that "You rock!" hand sign) You fuckin' rule!
No?  Damn, that one was my favorite.
(annoyed) Why are you doing this?
Is something wrong with the reception?
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Okay, well that about covers it. JIM'S DAD (cont'd) Now, let's put these somewhere where your mother won't find them.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
Turn that garbage off!  Give me that!
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
I think you need your balls reattached.
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
(half-joking) Stifler, you're such an asshole.
Shit, I can't believe a fine woman like this produced a guy like Stifler.
I don't know.  How do you?
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
(forced) No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
How come you have no date?
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
What do you suppose they're saying?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Um...I'm sort of wondering about...love.
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Right, and who told you that?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
What?!  How do I do that?
I wasn't making fun of you.
But, but -- what would I do?
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
(interrupting) What was your name again?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
(still singing) ...I needed someone to understand my ups and my downs, oh baby there you were...
What else would I call it?
It's not what it looks like!
(cutting her off) I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
So you need to change, right?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
(checks his watch) Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
Gentlemen, see you at the Bacchanalia.
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
So does your tongue cramp up?
I think we're falling in love.
Hey...what was that all about?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
(ignoring him) Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
(kung fu voice) Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
(fighting back tears) I guess...we'll just tell your mother...that we ate it all.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Oh, man, that's kind of sad.
(pause) You want to do it?
Of course, it was Stifler's mom.
You're missing the game for us?!
Do you know about the clitoris?
(shrugs) So you're going to Michigan?
Our last game is this Saturday.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
See -- this is the nicest room.
There's somebody going in there!
Don't you love my sexy body?!
(holds up a couple fingers) Contact, dude.
(fatherly attempt) Sit down, Jim.  Let's talk.
Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
(surprised himself) Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Well...jeez, don't laugh at me.
(gazing into her eyes) You're really beautiful.
Exactly three weeks to the day.
No...I know the perfect time...
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Son.  This lady's here for you.
I think "shithead" really says it.
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
Hail, hail, to Michigan, the leaders and best!
"You have established an internet connection."
So you like, work nights?
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Then she said -- she loves me.
But -- JIM (cont'd) Kevin, get back here!
Me too.  For the most part.
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
(trying to get away) -- Thanks, coach --
(not so confidently) Suck me...beautiful?
Mochaccino. (then) Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
Locked on target, flying in stealth mode under enemy sex radar.  Ready to drop the payload... again .
Jesus, what did you eat?
Jim?  Honey, where are you going?
(to Kevin's Brother) What's good here?
Hail! to the victors, valiant; Hail! to the conquering heroes, hail...
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Try the house down the street.
Dude!  That chick -- is a MILF!
Okay, don't stop. KEVIN (cont'd) Oh -- Now!
...oh -- that was a tit, tits...
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
You've just inherited The Bible.
(subtitled) That is one lucky man.
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
How do you know that?
Don't you want me to?
But you don't love me.
(pandering to them) Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
What did you just say?
That would be a start.
I still think you're okay.
I'm glad you think so.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Son, I wanted to talk to you about what I think you were trying to do the other day.
Wanna swap your chips for cookies?
You think she was serious?
Hey, what're you doing here?
All right, I got some scotch.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
Oh, shit!  There she is.  Nadia.
I think I've had one.
(interrupts authoritatively) No you haven't.
What are we gonna hear?
What the fuck is this?
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
What the heck is this?
That is a nasty story!
Dieter.  My middle name is Dieter.
(hushed, to guys) Don't you think you fellas could try a little tact?  I've got company.  Know what I mean?
We're here for the party?
What the hell is that?
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
I'm not good in math.
(through clenched teeth) Yes dad.
Okay.  You can do this.
What the hell was that?
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Come on!  I won't tell.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Steve!  Steve!  It's my computer and
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
That was a great night.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
I know, my timing's off.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
(flat) Okay, I get it.
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
I'll save you a seat.
This is your plan, Finch?
Stifler, you're such a jerk.
(laughing) I know, it sucks!
Uh, guys?  Was that Paul Finch?
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Oooh, spank me, daddy, spank me!
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex. (starts filling Vicky's beer) You've never even had one manually?
Give it to me!  Yes!
I do, baby, I do.
You can call me Ostreicher.
You can call me Oz.
Be back in a sec!
Kevin, it was just a --
Oz, it's okay, I know.
No!  Get out of here!
Yeahhh, you been bad, real bad!
Oh, thank you Lord, for this wonderful day. JIM (cont'd) Hey!  You can't touch my stuff! JIM (cont'd) Oh no no no.
(leans in to Jim) Kiss goodnight.
Apple pie... (then) McDonald's or homemade?
So, "shaved" is the expression?
You gotta be fucking kidding.
Jesus, Mom!  They're not illegal ! They're pay channels.  How could a television channel be illegal?!  God, get a clue!
Dickhead!  You gotta see this.
Stifler, how's the man chowder?!
(turned on) More sexy, Jim, more sexy.
(cheering, slapping him) Yeah, go Oz! etc.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
What?  We both have cars.
Oh, man!  This is incredible.
You need some work, buddy!
(brief pause) Let me know.
This was remade?  Into what?
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
You don't like it?
Uh...my dad's the manager.
Really, Stifler.  He's the manager.
Now!  Hames, come to me.
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
This isn't any better, Chris.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Dude, he does not.
(interrupting) I'll do it.
Come back to bed, James.
You've got something going?
Of course, I didn't --
You can crash at Stifler's?
Great evening, isn't it?
What party?  There's no party.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
I'm a sophisticated sex robot, sent back through time...to change the future for one lucky lady.
Hey, dad.  Did you knock?
You can do that?
You're gonna shit your pants!
I know.  Salt and pepper?
Do I have to?
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Play with my hairy balls!
...I've never tried it.
I'll think about it.
(through clenched teeth) Yes.
Yeah!  Sing for me!  yes!
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
What would I say?
She's a cartoon , dude.
Did I miss anything?!
Do you love her?
Hello James.  Ready to study.
Because I want to.
What about the game?!
You sure you're comfortable?
Come on come on come on...
I'm such a loser.
What?  No I'm not.
What's your middle name?
You mean like, strip strip?
No, it was good.
("for the hundredth time") This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
Keep it down, dude.
Yes ma'am, I am.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
Non habeo.  Canis meus id comedit.
Are you kidding?  No.
Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
(offended, a la Kevin) Please.
You got it, stud.
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
No!  I've got...reserve reserves!
Yeah, bring it on!
Now, the sex -- it's got to be valid, consensual sex.  No funny stuff.  And no prostitutes, if you were thinking about that, Finch.
(yelling) Dude, my farts fuckin' stink!
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
(sings along) And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
You mean...and orgasm?
Fuck yeah we will.
Yeti!  I am the Yeti!
Joanie, was that you?
So do I, Kev.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Once, in church, dude.
Shut the fuck up.
Victoria...I love you.
This is truly revolting.
You reek like a fuckin' Yeti, dude! Go take a shit or something!
Move with the music.
Of course, Finch.  What?
(loving it) Yeah, enormous.
She's a mermaid, dude.
Right.  That gives us...
Touch me Jim...here.
Nope.  He pissed himself.
What?  Not the Bible?
But that one time --
To the next step.
(yells) Mom?!  I'm home!
(so forced) Yes.  Seriously.
To the next step.
To the next step.
Say that again, Kevin?
You called me Oz.
(interrupting) That's good, Jim.
Oz -- You're back -- Yeah --
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Kevin, this is serious!
You talked to Stifler?
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Yeah man, right on!
(a wistful smile) Yeah.
No, a pact .  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
Great.  See you tomorrow.
(shakes his head) Hopeless.
Went home to shit.
God, what a buzzkill.
Ow, what the hell?
(irresistably sexy) For me?
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Yep, okay Mom, 'night.
Ring the bell again.
Jesus, we're all gonna go to college as virgins.  They've probably got special dorms for people like us.
No, I like the car. (then, direct) By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
(to Jim) Gotta go.
Well, I uh, I was -- (decides to stand her ground) I was asking Chris to prom. (turns to Oz) So do you wanna go?
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
He's no Paul Finch.
Yeah, okay Sherman, whatever.
I'll do it.
(choking) Must...be...broken...
You did it.
What happened?!  What happened?!
Hey, Finch.  Wanna dance?
It is too bad.  I was at first hoping you would ask me to the prom.  But... NADIA (cont'd) You should change your shorts.
Okay.  Albert, you ready?
Why is this?
The horror, the horror.
Neither will I.
Yeah, are you?
You're so big!
Whatever you want.
(almost frightened) Now?!
Not for you.
He's going in!
He blew it.  Literally.
I'm not going.
Neither did I!
You think so?
You're not...busy?
I'm not playing.
There's our man.
That's my trick!
I don't care.
No...you...go...ahead.
Shame on you!
I told you.
You got in.
There we go.
He likes it.
There we go.
Here we go.
(sighs) Doing what?
That's the spirit.
This is unexpected.
wanna use it!
I love you.
I love you.
Nice collection there, Jim.
No, not again.
I love you!
Fifteen minutes ago.
Hey mom hey dad!
Yeah, that's right.
And you said...
I like to keep my options open.  And let me just clarify that you have no chance of scoring with me, Finch.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
I know, Dad.
This way, sit.
Okay, okay.  You guys got about a minute to go.  Spend it warming up, not making out.  This ain't the prom yet.
That junior chick?
Ready for what?
Just in time.
Dad, come in.
Dude, prom sucks.
(shaking head) No.
Suck me, beautiful.
This.  Right now.
What's up, fellas?
Like a bet?
Dear God -- she's -- she's -- she's -- JIM (cont'd) Gentlemen, I'd like to make an announcement.  There is a gorgeous woman masturbating on my bed.
Man, shut up!
Work it, baby!
Bullshit.  From where?
Yeah, right here.
After getting laid?
Good morning gentleman.
Want a beer?
Oh my God!
No -- Kevin, you?
Dad!  I know!
(into phone) Jim must've addressed that E-mail wrong.  It went out to every mailbox in the East High directory.  God, how juvenile.
Nadia, I can't --
(nodding) Seduce her.
Oh, shit.  No!  Shit!
He's re-engaging!
You want onions?
After high school.
Qualify for what?
Fuck me!  Yes!
Stifler told me.
(pause) That's nice.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Okay, Heather, that was good, but I want to thicken up that solo. Michigan State is this Saturday, and I want that part to smoke .
(to Vicky) See?
Good luck, guys.
Not bad, Chris.
Hey, where's Finch?
(shifty) No way.
...excuse me?!
Ugh...oh no...
Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
And what we should do today, in band? Instead of playing our instruments regularly?  We should play them backwards!  That'll be so funny!
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
Feeling better, Oz?
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Good work, Ostreicher.
God dammit, Stifler!
Do you?
(gulps) Me?
Okay. VICKY (cont'd) Kevin...
(mutters) Holy shit.
(subtitled) Another bottle?
Stiff-lerrr!  Par-tyyy!!
What's that?
What's that?
He didn't?
It did.
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Then don't.
Me too.
(smiles) ...yeah.
I know.
Like what?
Not again.
Who cares?
Definitely not.
Like how?
That's stupid.
...Guess what?
Forget it.
Or not.
Ho-lee shit.
You comfortable?
Be gentle.
Just go!
Here, babe.
Alright, dude!
(barely) Yes.
Okay, explain.
No comment.
No problemo.
No idea.
Just relax.
Of course.
(running out of the room) Fuckers fuckers fuckers fuckers!
Oh no.
Oh no.
No way !
Hey, minuteman.
No shit.
Hell, just a pair of tight pants will set me off. (noticing Nadia next to them, she passes the tap along) Am I right or what, Nadia?
(chiming in as the chorus hits) Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Thanks guys.
Thanks coach.
Yeah, sure.
Yes, slowly.
Yeah right.
Oh, gross.
-- Oh, great.
This'll do.
Nice car.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
Sorry, coach.
What the hell?  I should be able to talk to chicks.  I'm articulate.  I got a 720 on my SAT verbal. (starts listing off words) Copious.  Verisimilitude.
Pardon me?
hot cartoon.
Uh-huh.
What reputation?
Oh yeah!
Well then keep it coming. (to everyone) Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
Uh huh.
Holy shit!
Well...uh...
Vicky, wait.
Vicky, wait!
Highly, highly overrated.
C-Span?
Oh, Kev.
Uh...dad...
Ugh...God...
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
Um...okay...
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Yeah Vick?
Oh...ungghhhhh!
(dismissive) Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Single malt?
Um...Chris --
Oh Jim...
Fuck me!  You're gonna have a naked Eastern-European chick in your house, and you're telling me you're not gonna take advantage of that?
(unaffected) Intransigence.
Whatever.
What?
What?
What?
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
What?!
What?!
Really?
How?
Again?
(offended) Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever. (then) What do you think I do?
Really?!
Here.
Nothing!
No.
Thanks.
Wait!
Bye.
Perfect.
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
Tonight?
Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
(yelling)
Dad.
Charming.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
...Yes?
Whoa.
Kind.
...okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Hey...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yep.
Yep.
Hi...
Sorry.
Woah!
Dammit!
Okay!
Orgasm?
Uh...
...okay...
Dad!!
Uh...
Yes!!
Yeah !
Yes --
What did you cocks do to him?  Shit, if Coach Marshall sees this, he'll kick Oz off the team on principle alone.
Regurgitation.
Pontificated.
Michelle.
Jim?
Strip?
Bummer.
Onions?
Aaaaaaarrrgghhhh!
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
(unison)
Stifler!!
Jim...
So, does my hair look better -- (flips a small lock of hair onto his forehead) like this, or... (flips it back up) like this?
(interrupting) No, Kevin -- (she sits up) That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance. (off their looks) When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.





No, I don't want a date... (increasingly dreamy) Finch is going stag...and so am I...the guy is like so...debonair.
(no idea) Yeah.  Right, uh-huh. (then, back into it) I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Yeah, we were up the whole night together.  We had one of those amazingly deep conversations, where you really feel like you get to know someone.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
(amused) Okay. (then) I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
Yeah, see it's on his stomach, here, and the eagle -- the eagle is actually grasping the python in its talons, so the snake is like his --
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got something between us.  Something good. Something special.
Alright, I got an idea.  But it stays between us.  Agreed? KEVIN (cont'd) Okay.  It's really simple.  We make an agreement -- no wait, more than an agreement.
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
Hey, man, I'm not making fun.  I'm fuckin' impressed.  I mean, "Footlong or six-inch, white or wheat," that's some serious shit to master.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age. (a beat) Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer -- (flips hair down again) Cool Hip Jim... (flips it back up) or Laid Back Jim?
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not all that I am.
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
I thought so. NADIA (cont'd) So you are having fun? NADIA (cont'd) I said, you are having fun? NADIA (cont'd) Me too. NADIA (cont'd) Well...I am going to get another beer. You want one?
In fact -- I should teach you my own special method.  I developed it myself at the ballet institute in Prague. You use nothing but the muscles of the inner thigh.
It reminds me of this one time -- (changing thoughts) Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Okay. (pause) So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed! MICHELLE (cont'd) So are we gonna screw soon?  I'm getting kind of antsy.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked. (off Kevin's look) I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
(sparking to this) You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
(momentarily puzzled) I do when I'm throwing them at your mom, you damn freak. (then) Alright then, see you guys tonight. I'll look for you in the No Fucking section.
(offended) Please. (then) We're all golden, we're college bound. I figured it out -- I can get a c- minus in every class, and it's not gonna make a difference.  U of M, here I come.
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Alright!  Good hustle, guys, but we can still lose.  You all saw what happened to Oz out there.  I don't ever want to see you guys thinking you're gonna score.  You don't score until you score, period.
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
Attitude?  Me?  I think that you guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
Come on man.  Tonight is the night. We're finally going to a post-prom party on the lake.  We've been waiting to do this for the last four years. Why else are we still friends with Stifler?  You gotta go.
(continuing with his prepared speech) Now, you may have tried it in the shower, or maybe in bed at night, and not even known what you were doing. Or perhaps you've heard your friends talking about it in the locker room.
She's already on a plane back home. JIM (cont'd) You know, maybe I'm just not good with girls, period.  Like I was born without that part of the brain.  I mean, I can't talk to girls.  And when I do talk to them, I screw it up.
Dammit, Jim, get some fucking balls. If you don't have the guts to photograph a naked chick in your room, how are you ever gonna sleep with one? Now all you gotta do is set up some sort of private link or whatever on the net, and tell me the address.
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know. OZ (cont'd) See, uh, I'm a virgin.  And me, Kevin, Jim, and Finch, we all made this pact. That we would...lose our virginity... before high school was over. OZ (cont'd) And, see, tonight is supposed to be the night we all do it.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
So once Hal becomes king, he has to take on the responsibilities of leadership, and turn his back on his old, drunken friend, Falstaff.  You see, Hal was going through a rite of passage, much like you all are.  Make the most of the time you've got left together.  You'll miss it later.
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
That's great.  Now remember, it's okay to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it -- (elbows Jim) "Stroke the salami!" (chuckles) Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We all masturbate. JIM'S DAD (cont'd) Poor guy thought he was the only one.
It all boils down to today.  For you seniors, this marks the culmination of your past four years.  Think of what that means to you.  Are you guys gonna look back on your days at East and know that you made the most of the time you had? COACH MARSHALL (cont'd) Now that's the attitude, Ostreicher!
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball. (a beat) You do want a partner, don't you son?
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but -- OZ (cont'd) I feel like I've already won. OZ (cont'd) And, well, I really care about you.  A lot.  And I want you to know that.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. (then) Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused!  From now on, we fight for every man out there who isn't getting laid when he should be! This is our day!  This is our time! And, by God, we're not gonna let history condemn us to celibacy!  We will make a stand!  We will succeed! We will get laid !
This isn't how I wanted things to turn out.  Making the pact wasn't just about getting laid.  It was about doing one last thing with you guys before we graduated.  But now I've just wasted my last few weeks here trying to do what?  I don't even know. All I managed to do was fuck up our friendship.
Excuse me, everyone, sorry to interrupt. CENTRAL GIRL (cont'd) I just wanted to let you all know this:  Chuck Sherman is a liar.  I never had sex with him.  He's never had sex with anyone -- I know because he told me.  Once, he tried to screw a grapefruit, but that's it.  Oh, and he also told me that sometimes when he gets nervous he wets his pants.  Thank you for your attention.
It originally started as a sex manual, this book that some guys brought back from Amsterdam in the early eighties. What to do with your tongue, things like that.  And each year, it got passed on to one East student who was worthy of it. KEVIN'S BROTHER(cont'd) After a couple years, guys started adding their own techniques.  Things they figured out themselves. KEVIN'S BROTHER(cont'd) You have to keep it a secret, and return it at the end of the year.  So, now you know.  Good luck.
(interrupting, pissed) I don't have to do shit!  Forget it already! JIM (cont'd) I'm tired of all this bullshit pressure!  I mean, I've never even had sex and already I can't stand it!  I hate sex!  I don't want it, I've never wanted it, and I'm not gonna sit here busting my balls over something that just isn't that damn important!  So fuck this stupid pact, fuck you , and fuck sex!  Now, I'm gonna go hang out with that geek over there, 'cause at least she's got something else to talk about besides sex!  God damn!
And so, one time?  I was at band camp? And we weren't supposed to have pillow fights?  But we had a pillow fight! And it was so much fun! MICHELLE (cont'd) And one time, we all lost our music? And we were supposed to play this song?  But we didn't know it.  So we just made it up!  And we kept playing and playing but the conductor didn't know what we were doing and it was so funny! MICHELLE (cont'd) So you're pissed about something, huh? You know what I do when I'm angry?  I just play some Bach on my flute.  It's so relaxing.  I learned to do that at band camp.

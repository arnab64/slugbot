Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
A little, but I think it'll work better as a duet.  With a tenor part.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at her store.
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
(no bones about it) You are right.  The hands are not always necessary.
Is it cool?  I heard it was like an eagle, blazing in fire and stuff.
(a little angry) Steve!  You could at least look at me when you say that.
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Back out?  You don't need us to get laid.  You afraid or something?
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
What the fuck is this?  You got someplace more important to be?
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
I'm on the offensive, boys.  The Sherman Tank is going back in.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
(with a really sexy accent) You are in my English class, no?
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
(yells to Vicky's Dad) Hon?  Can you tell Vick to come on down for supper?
I -- I don't get it, how the hell did you do that?
(beaten) I'll have to save this speech for another day.  I'm too worn out.
What ?? (he dismisses it) Whatever -- look uh, don't forget -- my cottage after prom.  On Lake Michigan.
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic.  This was before the cheesy remake.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Oz, how about you and Heather?  Now you guys are a couple or something?
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it. (hits him lightly) Way to go, Kev!
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
(dry) As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
(smiles) I'll just say that we had a great night together.
You know what the coolest thing is? This, right now.
I think he's trying to watch one of the illegal channels.
(off their looks) Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
You know it's just gonna be some crappy band and stupid decorations.
(sighs) I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
Man, I just gotta get laid already! This blowjob thing is bullshit!
Just don't bring it up, hang low, maybe she won't mention it again.
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Dude, watch me work.  They go for sensitive studs like me.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Oh, Jim!  I'm looking at the ol' family portrait, here.  Yep.  It's a good one.
No, no that's fine. (then, to Kevin) So you doing okay?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
I was being selfish.  And majorly insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
(genuine) I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Kevin... (very close, whispered) I want to have sex with you.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
What am I gonna do, broadcast her over the internet?
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Yeah.  Damn cable.  There's this nature show that I'm trying to watch.
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
And you got a keg, too, wow. (realizing) Oh, wait, I left my beer downstairs.
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
It was a pact .  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
I know it's a long shot, but I figure Paul Finch might ask me.
Do you think that "older woman" thing is true?
Aged eighteen years. (she gives him a look) Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
Okay...that would be cool sometime. (sees the guys gesticulating) How 'bout tomorrow?
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
(wandering down from upstairs) What the hell are you losers doing?
Shut up and watch this, you might learn something.
You guys have like, seen him in the locker room, right?
(immediately sensing danger) Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Wow, that's amazing, she's probably gonna want to do it soon.
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
This is like the coolest thing I've ever seen.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
(nods, loving it) Actually, it's an eagle and this big python.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
Observe. KEVIN (cont'd) Excuse me.  Do you know who Paul Finch is?
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
It was just my time, fellas, it was just my time.  Best of luck to you, boys.
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
(a little aggravated) Yeah, I know.  I'm working on it.
You're just saying that cause prom's a week away and you don't have a date.
Hah!  Central sucks! (noticing Heather) Choir Chick?  What the hell are you doing here?
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Honey, why don't you let me handle this one.
(trumping him) Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
Vicky, shhh, you know there's no lock on your door.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
(trying not to look inside) Can I come in?
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Jesus Christ.  The dictionary?  Hell, son, I'll buy you some dirty magazines.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Hmm.  You know that's (cracking up) really a shitty middle name!
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot .
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.
Woah.  Does he have a date for prom yet.
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
It's all good. (He pulls out some gum) Breath check.
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
Stifler, fuck -- (noticing Heather, "sensitive") ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Come on, I'll drop you off at your friends'.
I'm sorry, I really can't go with you...I'm holding out for someone else.
That was awesome ! do see is the kitchen door handle rattling.  The
"You have lost your internet connection.  Click 'okay' to reconnect." his dance.  He stops.  ALMOST
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
Focus on the music.  Think melody. Let the music be my guide.
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
Look... (searching, remembers) ...Sarah.  I wouldn't go telling stories or whatever about you.  I promise.
(ribbing her) Go talk to him, maybe you can teach him how to read.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
(deep macho voice) Ohhh, tell me you're a nasty girl!
Ringing the bell is dorky -- let's just go in.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
(shoving the rubbers into his night table) Just a minute!
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Alright then.  It's official.  Any questions? KEVIN (cont'd) To the next step.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Oh, well... (noticing Heather looking at him, he acts "sensitive") It came from the heart.
My man Oz, working it with the choir babes?
(cheery) Come on, you know the words, sing along.
(nudge, nudge) "Deep conversation," huh?  Is that what you guys call it?
Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you. JIM'S DAD (cont'd) This, son, is your more exotic dirty magazine.
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
Then what the hell are you talking about?
(upset but trying to be cool) ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
I had no idea you'd be this good!
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You like her?  Her sponsor family lives on my block.  Why don't you talk to her?
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
(dumbfounded) Finch hasn't done a damn thing, and he's got girls lining up already.
I know. (a beat) Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
Oh, you bet he is.  Jim's quite the bookworm.
(into phone) Hey.  I got another question for you.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
(playful) Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
(to Jim) I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
(chastising) James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
(repulsed) Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Did you get the flowers? (no response) What about the poem? KEVIN (cont'd) Vicky, please don't do this.
Yeah...so like, what else do you do?
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
So, I guess you and Sherman are pretty close.  You met at that party a while back?
(like it's no big deal) I know.  Hey Nadia.
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
You know, after I graduated high school, my parents let me do some traveling...
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
(interrupting, hand up) Thank you, dad, I got it.
(snippets of conversation) ...I'll never forget...thank you.
Hey, Jimmy.  I just wanted to say sweet dreams.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
(snapping) Dammit!  If Sherman has sex before I do, I'm gonna be really fucking pissed.
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
(going on) The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
(eyes tearing) Son.  That's the best damn story I ever heard.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Hey, we've got Conan the Barbarian singing with us.
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
(barely, overwhelmed) I suppose that would be okay.
(getting really turned on) More, more, you bad boy!
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
(brushing it off her skirt) Whoops, excuse me...
Looks like you could use an extra hand.
James, don't speak that way to your mother!
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
No, go right ahead and get dressed. I'll just be downstairs, studying up. Get me when you're ready.
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
At least I learned how to shit in school.
He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.  Knocked out a tooth, but you can't see it.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
(subtitled) He knows how to treat a woman.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
About the other day...I've been thinking.
Oh gosh, I forgot -- you uh, you look okay...I mean you can't even tell...
This is pathetic.  I'm gonna find me a little hottie. STIFLER (O.S.)(cont'd) (yelling) Suck me, beautiful!
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
Woah, no way!  That guy is so cool!
There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
The difference is so phenomenal, I can't decide.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
(singing happily) ...I needed the shelter of someone's arms...there you were -- woo-hoo- hoo...
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean really fast.
It is far away...and we'll be on our own...meeting new people...
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
No wonder she never pays attention in class.
If I might ask, when you brush your teeth, do you spit or swallow?
Maybe he'll crush some beer cans on his forehead.
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
I'll give you a hint. (hot, orgasmic) "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!" (flat) Comprende?
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
Is it true that he's really...huge?
These are for you.  From father to son.
You can send me the address too.
She's around.  Seems that she's taken a liking to me.  Fellas, it's time that she experienced -- The Sherminator.
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is really old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
A foolproof plan, my friend.  You shall see.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
How did you know I was here?
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
I don't get it, that really works?
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Just tell her what's on your mind. And smile, you've got a good smile. (then to Kevin) Come on.
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
No, of course not, don't be ridiculous.
Do you commonly grasp warm pieces of stool?
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Okay. (a beat) Did you bring a condom?
Go ahead son, there's more. JIM'S DAD (cont'd) Now, that one's a little more...a little more...graphic.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
M-I-L-F!  Mom I'd Like to Fuck!
Just a second! VICKY (cont'd) (a little too loudly) Oh, God! VICKY (cont'd) Moly shmmmt!  Fmmkkkk!
I want to hear you say it.
Of course!  Have you guys seen his tattoo?
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Did you guys hook up or something?
(to Jim) You guys got the Latin homework?
I highly recommend you join the club.
First of all, it's Mocha ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
I think he's got a nice voice.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin. (she turns to him) But I did pick it up from you.
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
(deadpan) I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. (a beat) So I guess...I'll see you later.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you? KEVIN (cont'd) (into phone) Hello?  Hey Sherman...what?!  How did you know?
So we're gonna be close next year?
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
Hey, that guy's in my trig class.
I can't believe Oz had to work.
(pause) You can't sing at the competition.
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
That's the next book, Kevin.  That's the next book.
Shit, I can't believe a fine woman like this produced a guy like Stifler.
Okay.  I'm here for your dumb...dumb meeting.
You guys are gonna fuck, aren't you!?
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
Still questing after the holy grail, eh guys?
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
She's gone. JIM (cont'd) Oh my God.  She used me. JIM (cont'd) Wow!  I was used!  Cool!
(hysterical, toppling over) You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
Okay, well that about covers it. JIM'S DAD (cont'd) Now, let's put these somewhere where your mother won't find them.
(trying to decipher the guys' signals) Yes.  No.  Yes.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
(cutting her off) I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
(gives that "You rock!" hand sign) You fuckin' rule!
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
(still singing) ...I needed someone to understand my ups and my downs, oh baby there you were...
(getting ticked) Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
That's not why we're going out.
(kung fu voice) Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
I do like your dirty magazines.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Is something wrong with the reception?
No?  Damn, that one was my favorite.
(half-joking) Stifler, you're such an asshole.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
I think you need your balls reattached.
(fighting back tears) I guess...we'll just tell your mother...that we ate it all.
(annoyed) Why are you doing this?
Turn that garbage off!  Give me that!
(checks his watch) Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Um...I'm sort of wondering about...love.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
(forced) No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
I wasn't making fun of you.
How come you have no date?
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
Please, God.  Let this be it.
Right, and who told you that?
I think we're falling in love.
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
(ignoring him) Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
It's not what it looks like!
What do you suppose they're saying?
What else would I call it?
Gentlemen, see you at the Bacchanalia.
So you need to change, right?
But, but -- what would I do?
What?!  How do I do that?
(interrupting) What was your name again?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
I don't know.  How do you?
Oh, man, that's kind of sad.
Hey...what was that all about?
So does your tongue cramp up?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Of course, it was Stifler's mom.
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
See -- this is the nicest room.
Well...jeez, don't laugh at me.
(pause) You want to do it?
Our last game is this Saturday.
You're missing the game for us?!
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
Do you know about the clitoris?
(shrugs) So you're going to Michigan?
(holds up a couple fingers) Contact, dude.
Well, I do have ballet practice. Perhaps I can come by your house afterwards.  I can change clothes at your place?
There's somebody going in there!
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Check-out time!  Please vacate the room.
No...I know the perfect time...
Don't you love my sexy body?!
(gazing into her eyes) You're really beautiful.
Hail, hail, to Michigan, the leaders and best!
(surprised himself) Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Exactly three weeks to the day.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
(fatherly attempt) Sit down, Jim.  Let's talk.
I think "shithead" really says it.
Locked on target, flying in stealth mode under enemy sex radar.  Ready to drop the payload... again .
(pandering to them) Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
Then she said -- she loves me.
But -- JIM (cont'd) Kevin, get back here!
Mochaccino. (then) Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
(trying to get away) -- Thanks, coach --
(not so confidently) Suck me...beautiful?
Son.  This lady's here for you.
So you like, work nights?
"You have established an internet connection."
Son, I wanted to talk to you about what I think you were trying to do the other day.
Me too.  For the most part.
(to Kevin's Brother) What's good here?
Hail! to the victors, valiant; Hail! to the conquering heroes, hail...
Try the house down the street.
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
Jesus, what did you eat?
...oh -- that was a tit, tits...
(subtitled) That is one lucky man.
Okay, don't stop. KEVIN (cont'd) Oh -- Now!
Dude!  That chick -- is a MILF!
Jim?  Honey, where are you going?
You've just inherited The Bible.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
How do you know that?
But you don't love me.
Don't you want me to?
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
I still think you're okay.
I'm glad you think so.
That would be a start.
All right, I got some scotch.
What did you just say?
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
Wanna swap your chips for cookies?
We're here for the party?
That is a nasty story!
I'm not good in math.
I think I've had one.
(through clenched teeth) Yes dad.
(interrupts authoritatively) No you haven't.
What are we gonna hear?
What the fuck is this?
What the heck is this?
You think she was serious?
Hey, what're you doing here?
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
What the hell is that?
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Oh, shit!  There she is.  Nadia.
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Dieter.  My middle name is Dieter.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
What the hell was that?
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
(hushed, to guys) Don't you think you fellas could try a little tact?  I've got company.  Know what I mean?
(laughing) I know, it sucks!
Okay.  You can do this.
(flat) Okay, I get it.
That was a great night.
I know, my timing's off.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Come on!  I won't tell.
Oooh, spank me, daddy, spank me!
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
I'll save you a seat.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
(leans in to Jim) Kiss goodnight.
Steve!  Steve!  It's my computer and
Stifler, you're such a jerk.
(turned on) More sexy, Jim, more sexy.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
This is your plan, Finch?
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Oh, thank you Lord, for this wonderful day. JIM (cont'd) Hey!  You can't touch my stuff! JIM (cont'd) Oh no no no.
I do, baby, I do.
I'm a sophisticated sex robot, sent back through time...to change the future for one lucky lady.
Be back in a sec!
Kevin, it was just a --
Give it to me!  Yes!
You can call me Ostreicher.
Yeahhh, you been bad, real bad!
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
You can call me Oz.
Apple pie... (then) McDonald's or homemade?
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex. (starts filling Vicky's beer) You've never even had one manually?
Uh, guys?  Was that Paul Finch?
No!  Get out of here!
You gotta be fucking kidding.
Stifler, how's the man chowder?!
So, "shaved" is the expression?
(cheering, slapping him) Yeah, go Oz! etc.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
You need some work, buddy!
(brief pause) Let me know.
Uh...my dad's the manager.
Jesus, Mom!  They're not illegal ! They're pay channels.  How could a television channel be illegal?!  God, get a clue!
Dickhead!  You gotta see this.
Oh, man!  This is incredible.
You don't like it?
This isn't any better, Chris.
What?  We both have cars.
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Now!  Hames, come to me.
Come back to bed, James.
Really, Stifler.  He's the manager.
This was remade?  Into what?
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Dude, he does not.
Of course, I didn't --
(sings along) And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
(interrupting) I'll do it.
You can crash at Stifler's?
You've got something going?
Great evening, isn't it?
What party?  There's no party.
Play with my hairy balls!
You're gonna shit your pants!
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
I know.  Salt and pepper?
(through clenched teeth) Yes.
You can do that?
Hey, dad.  Did you knock?
Do I have to?
...I've never tried it.
I'll think about it.
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
She's a cartoon , dude.
What would I say?
Come on come on come on...
Yeah!  Sing for me!  yes!
Did I miss anything?!
("for the hundredth time") This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
Because I want to.
You sure you're comfortable?
Hello James.  Ready to study.
Do you love her?
What about the game?!
I'm such a loser.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
No, it was good.
(offended, a la Kevin) Please.
Keep it down, dude.
You mean like, strip strip?
(yelling) Dude, my farts fuckin' stink!
Yes ma'am, I am.
What's your middle name?
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
Non habeo.  Canis meus id comedit.
What?  No I'm not.
Now, the sex -- it's got to be valid, consensual sex.  No funny stuff.  And no prostitutes, if you were thinking about that, Finch.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Yeah, bring it on!
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
You got it, stud.
Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
No!  I've got...reserve reserves!
Are you kidding?  No.
Fuck yeah we will.
You mean...and orgasm?
So do I, Kev.
You reek like a fuckin' Yeti, dude! Go take a shit or something!
Once, in church, dude.
Shut the fuck up.
(loving it) Yeah, enormous.
Yeti!  I am the Yeti!
Victoria...I love you.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
This is truly revolting.
Joanie, was that you?
Move with the music.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Touch me Jim...here.
She's a mermaid, dude.
But that one time --
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
To the next step.
To the next step.
To the next step.
Right.  That gives us...
(a wistful smile) Yeah.
No, a pact .  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
Of course, Finch.  What?
Nope.  He pissed himself.
(interrupting) That's good, Jim.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Say that again, Kevin?
(yells) Mom?!  I'm home!
(so forced) Yes.  Seriously.
You called me Oz.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Kevin, this is serious!
What?  Not the Bible?
Yeah man, right on!
Oz -- You're back -- Yeah --
You talked to Stifler?
(shakes his head) Hopeless.
Jesus, we're all gonna go to college as virgins.  They've probably got special dorms for people like us.
Went home to shit.
Great.  See you tomorrow.
God, what a buzzkill.
(irresistably sexy) For me?
Ow, what the hell?
Yep, okay Mom, 'night.
Well, I uh, I was -- (decides to stand her ground) I was asking Chris to prom. (turns to Oz) So do you wanna go?
Ring the bell again.
No, I like the car. (then, direct) By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
(to Jim) Gotta go.
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
Yeah, okay Sherman, whatever.
He's no Paul Finch.
I'll do it.
(choking) Must...be...broken...
What happened?!  What happened?!
It is too bad.  I was at first hoping you would ask me to the prom.  But... NADIA (cont'd) You should change your shorts.
Okay.  Albert, you ready?
You did it.
The horror, the horror.
Hey, Finch.  Wanna dance?
Why is this?
I like to keep my options open.  And let me just clarify that you have no chance of scoring with me, Finch.
Neither will I.
Whatever you want.
I'm not playing.
(almost frightened) Now?!
He likes it.
Not for you.
He's going in!
He blew it.  Literally.
I don't care.
I'm not going.
Neither did I!
You're so big!
No...you...go...ahead.
There's our man.
There we go.
There we go.
Here we go.
That's my trick!
Yeah, are you?
You think so?
Nice collection there, Jim.
Shame on you!
I told you.
You got in.
You're not...busy?
I love you.
I love you.
No, not again.
Okay, okay.  You guys got about a minute to go.  Spend it warming up, not making out.  This ain't the prom yet.
I love you!
Just dial 976-Asshole.
That's the spirit.
This is unexpected.
wanna use it!
Hey mom hey dad!
(sighs) Doing what?
Fifteen minutes ago.
Dear God -- she's -- she's -- she's -- JIM (cont'd) Gentlemen, I'd like to make an announcement.  There is a gorgeous woman masturbating on my bed.
I know, Dad.
Yeah, that's right.
And you said...
This way, sit.
That junior chick?
Ready for what?
Just in time.
Suck me, beautiful.
Dad, come in.
Dude, prom sucks.
(shaking head) No.
Man, shut up!
Like a bet?
This.  Right now.
Work it, baby!
What's up, fellas?
(into phone) Jim must've addressed that E-mail wrong.  It went out to every mailbox in the East High directory.  God, how juvenile.
Good morning gentleman.
Yeah, right here.
After getting laid?
Oh my God!
Want a beer?
Bullshit.  From where?
Okay, Heather, that was good, but I want to thicken up that solo. Michigan State is this Saturday, and I want that part to smoke .
Nadia, I can't --
(nodding) Seduce her.
Dad!  I know!
No -- Kevin, you?
He's re-engaging!
After high school.
Oh, shit.  No!  Shit!
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Qualify for what?
You want onions?
Stifler told me.
Fuck me!  Yes!
(pause) That's nice.
Good luck, guys.
(to Vicky) See?
Not bad, Chris.
(shifty) No way.
Hey, where's Finch?
Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
...excuse me?!
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Ugh...oh no...
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
Feeling better, Oz?
Good work, Ostreicher.
And what we should do today, in band? Instead of playing our instruments regularly?  We should play them backwards!  That'll be so funny!
God dammit, Stifler!
Okay. VICKY (cont'd) Kevin...
(mutters) Holy shit.
(chiming in as the chorus hits) Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
(gulps) Me?
(subtitled) Another bottle?
Stiff-lerrr!  Par-tyyy!!
Do you?
Uh...yeah...sorry.
What's that?
What's that?
He didn't?
(smiles) ...yeah.
It did.
Me too.
Then don't.
I know.
Definitely not.
Not again.
Who cares?
Like what?
Forget it.
Ho-lee shit.
Like how?
(running out of the room) Fuckers fuckers fuckers fuckers!
That's stupid.
...Guess what?
Or not.
Hell, just a pair of tight pants will set me off. (noticing Nadia next to them, she passes the tap along) Am I right or what, Nadia?
Alright, dude!
Be gentle.
You comfortable?
Just go!
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
Here, babe.
Okay, explain.
(barely) Yes.
No comment.
Just relax.
No problemo.
No idea.
Of course.
Well then keep it coming. (to everyone) Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
Oh no.
Oh no.
No way !
Hey, minuteman.
No shit.
Thanks guys.
Thanks coach.
Yeah, sure.
Yes, slowly.
-- Oh, great.
Yeah right.
Oh, gross.
Nice car.
Sorry, coach.
This'll do.
hot cartoon.
Uh-huh.
Pardon me?
What the hell?  I should be able to talk to chicks.  I'm articulate.  I got a 720 on my SAT verbal. (starts listing off words) Copious.  Verisimilitude.
Oh yeah!
Uh huh.
What reputation?
Holy shit!
Well...uh...
Vicky, wait.
(dismissive) Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Vicky, wait!
Highly, highly overrated.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
C-Span?
Oh, Kev.
Uh...dad...
Um...okay...
Ugh...God...
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Yeah Vick?
Um...Chris --
Oh Jim...
Single malt?
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
Fuck me!  You're gonna have a naked Eastern-European chick in your house, and you're telling me you're not gonna take advantage of that?
(unaffected) Intransigence.
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
Whatever.
(offended) Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever. (then) What do you think I do?
What?
What?
What?
What?!
What?!
Really?
How?
Again?
Here.
Nothing!
Really?!
No.
So, does my hair look better -- (flips a small lock of hair onto his forehead) like this, or... (flips it back up) like this?
Thanks.
Wait!
Perfect.
Bye.
Sure.
Sure.
Sure.
Charming.
Okay.
Okay.
Kind.
...okay.
Okay.
Okay.
(yelling)
Dad.
Tonight?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Hey...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay!
Yeah.
Yep.
Yep.
Hi...
...okay...
Sorry.
...Yes?
Woah!
Dammit!
Uh...
Dad!!
Uh...
Orgasm?
Yes!!
What did you cocks do to him?  Shit, if Coach Marshall sees this, he'll kick Oz off the team on principle alone.
Yeah !
Yes --
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
Regurgitation.
Pontificated.
Michelle.
Bummer.
Aaaaaaarrrgghhhh!
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Jim?
Strip?
(unison)
Onions?
Stifler!!
Jim...
(interrupting) No, Kevin -- (she sits up) That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance. (off their looks) When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
No, I don't want a date... (increasingly dreamy) Finch is going stag...and so am I...the guy is like so...debonair.





Yeah, we were up the whole night together.  We had one of those amazingly deep conversations, where you really feel like you get to know someone.
(no idea) Yeah.  Right, uh-huh. (then, back into it) I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Yeah, see it's on his stomach, here, and the eagle -- the eagle is actually grasping the python in its talons, so the snake is like his --
(amused) Okay. (then) I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got something between us.  Something good. Something special.
Alright, I got an idea.  But it stays between us.  Agreed? KEVIN (cont'd) Okay.  It's really simple.  We make an agreement -- no wait, more than an agreement.
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
Hey, man, I'm not making fun.  I'm fuckin' impressed.  I mean, "Footlong or six-inch, white or wheat," that's some serious shit to master.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age. (a beat) Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer -- (flips hair down again) Cool Hip Jim... (flips it back up) or Laid Back Jim?
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not all that I am.
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
I thought so. NADIA (cont'd) So you are having fun? NADIA (cont'd) I said, you are having fun? NADIA (cont'd) Me too. NADIA (cont'd) Well...I am going to get another beer. You want one?
In fact -- I should teach you my own special method.  I developed it myself at the ballet institute in Prague. You use nothing but the muscles of the inner thigh.
It reminds me of this one time -- (changing thoughts) Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Okay. (pause) So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed! MICHELLE (cont'd) So are we gonna screw soon?  I'm getting kind of antsy.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass he kicked. (off Kevin's look) I'll tell you one thing, though.  I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
(sparking to this) You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
(momentarily puzzled) I do when I'm throwing them at your mom, you damn freak. (then) Alright then, see you guys tonight. I'll look for you in the No Fucking section.
(offended) Please. (then) We're all golden, we're college bound. I figured it out -- I can get a c- minus in every class, and it's not gonna make a difference.  U of M, here I come.
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Alright!  Good hustle, guys, but we can still lose.  You all saw what happened to Oz out there.  I don't ever want to see you guys thinking you're gonna score.  You don't score until you score, period.
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
Attitude?  Me?  I think that you guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
Come on man.  Tonight is the night. We're finally going to a post-prom party on the lake.  We've been waiting to do this for the last four years. Why else are we still friends with Stifler?  You gotta go.
(continuing with his prepared speech) Now, you may have tried it in the shower, or maybe in bed at night, and not even known what you were doing. Or perhaps you've heard your friends talking about it in the locker room.
She's already on a plane back home. JIM (cont'd) You know, maybe I'm just not good with girls, period.  Like I was born without that part of the brain.  I mean, I can't talk to girls.  And when I do talk to them, I screw it up.
Dammit, Jim, get some fucking balls. If you don't have the guts to photograph a naked chick in your room, how are you ever gonna sleep with one? Now all you gotta do is set up some sort of private link or whatever on the net, and tell me the address.
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know. OZ (cont'd) See, uh, I'm a virgin.  And me, Kevin, Jim, and Finch, we all made this pact. That we would...lose our virginity... before high school was over. OZ (cont'd) And, see, tonight is supposed to be the night we all do it.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
So once Hal becomes king, he has to take on the responsibilities of leadership, and turn his back on his old, drunken friend, Falstaff.  You see, Hal was going through a rite of passage, much like you all are.  Make the most of the time you've got left together.  You'll miss it later.
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
That's great.  Now remember, it's okay to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it -- (elbows Jim) "Stroke the salami!" (chuckles) Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We all masturbate. JIM'S DAD (cont'd) Poor guy thought he was the only one.
It all boils down to today.  For you seniors, this marks the culmination of your past four years.  Think of what that means to you.  Are you guys gonna look back on your days at East and know that you made the most of the time you had? COACH MARSHALL (cont'd) Now that's the attitude, Ostreicher!
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball. (a beat) You do want a partner, don't you son?
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but -- OZ (cont'd) I feel like I've already won. OZ (cont'd) And, well, I really care about you.  A lot.  And I want you to know that.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. (then) Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused!  From now on, we fight for every man out there who isn't getting laid when he should be! This is our day!  This is our time! And, by God, we're not gonna let history condemn us to celibacy!  We will make a stand!  We will succeed! We will get laid !
This isn't how I wanted things to turn out.  Making the pact wasn't just about getting laid.  It was about doing one last thing with you guys before we graduated.  But now I've just wasted my last few weeks here trying to do what?  I don't even know. All I managed to do was fuck up our friendship.
Excuse me, everyone, sorry to interrupt. CENTRAL GIRL (cont'd) I just wanted to let you all know this:  Chuck Sherman is a liar.  I never had sex with him.  He's never had sex with anyone -- I know because he told me.  Once, he tried to screw a grapefruit, but that's it.  Oh, and he also told me that sometimes when he gets nervous he wets his pants.  Thank you for your attention.
It originally started as a sex manual, this book that some guys brought back from Amsterdam in the early eighties. What to do with your tongue, things like that.  And each year, it got passed on to one East student who was worthy of it. KEVIN'S BROTHER(cont'd) After a couple years, guys started adding their own techniques.  Things they figured out themselves. KEVIN'S BROTHER(cont'd) You have to keep it a secret, and return it at the end of the year.  So, now you know.  Good luck.
(interrupting, pissed) I don't have to do shit!  Forget it already! JIM (cont'd) I'm tired of all this bullshit pressure!  I mean, I've never even had sex and already I can't stand it!  I hate sex!  I don't want it, I've never wanted it, and I'm not gonna sit here busting my balls over something that just isn't that damn important!  So fuck this stupid pact, fuck you , and fuck sex!  Now, I'm gonna go hang out with that geek over there, 'cause at least she's got something else to talk about besides sex!  God damn!
And so, one time?  I was at band camp? And we weren't supposed to have pillow fights?  But we had a pillow fight! And it was so much fun! MICHELLE (cont'd) And one time, we all lost our music? And we were supposed to play this song?  But we didn't know it.  So we just made it up!  And we kept playing and playing but the conductor didn't know what we were doing and it was so funny! MICHELLE (cont'd) So you're pissed about something, huh? You know what I do when I'm angry?  I just play some Bach on my flute.  It's so relaxing.  I learned to do that at band camp.
